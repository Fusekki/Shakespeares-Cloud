<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<line>Foolery &#383;ir, does walke about the Orbe like the</line>

<line>The quality of per&#383;ons, and the time:</line>
<line>And like the Haggard, checke at euery Feather</line>
<line>That comes before his eye. This is a pra&#392;tice,</line>
<line>As full of labour as a Wi&#383;e-mans Art:</line>
<line>For folly that he wi&#383;ely &#383;hewes, is fit;</line>

<line>Loue &#383;ought, is good: but giuen vn&#383;ought, is better.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>By innocence I &#383;weare, and by my youth,</line>
<line>I haue one heart, one bo&#383;ome, and one truth,</line>
<line>And that no woman has, nor neuer none</line>
<line>Shall mi&#383;tris be of it, &#383;aue I alone.</line>
