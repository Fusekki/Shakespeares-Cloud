<line>And in the meane time &#383;oiourn&#8217;d at my fathers;</line>
<line>Where how he did preuaile, I &#383;hame to &#383;peake:</line>
<line>But truth is truth, large lengths of &#383;eas and &#383;hores</line>
<line>Betweene my father, and my mother lay,</line>
<line>As I haue heard my father &#383;peake him&#383;elfe</line>
<line>When this &#383;ame lu&#383;ty gentleman was got:</line>
<line>Vpon his death-bed he by will bequeath&#8217;d</line>

<line>Had of your father claim&#8217;d this &#383;onne for his,</line>
<line>In&#383;ooth, good friend, your father might haue kept</line>
<line>This Calfe, bred from his Cow from all the world:</line>
<line>In&#383;ooth he might: then if he were my brothers,</line>
<line>My brother might not claime him, nor your father</line>
<line>Being none of his, refu&#383;e him: this concludes,</line>
<line>My mothers &#383;onne did get your fathers heyre,</line>
