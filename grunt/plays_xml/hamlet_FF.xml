<line>&#8217;Tis &#383;weet and commendable</line>
<line>In your Nature <nameref>Hamlet</nameref>,</line>
<line>To giue the&#383;e mourning duties to your Father:</line>
<line>But you mu&#383;t know, your Father lo&#383;t a Father,</line>
<line>That Father lo&#383;t, lo&#383;t his, and the Suruiuer bound</line>
<line>In filiall Obligation, for &#383;ome terme</line>
<line>To do ob&#383;equious Sorrow. But to per&#383;euer</line>
<line>In ob&#383;tinate Condolement, is a cour&#383;e</line>
<line>Of impious &#383;tubbornne&#383;&#383;e. &#8217;Tis vnmanly greefe,</line>
<line>It &#383;hewes a will mo&#383;t incorre&#392;t to Heauen,</line>
<line>A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,</line>
<line>An Vnder&#383;tanding &#383;imple, and vn&#383;chool&#8217;d:</line>
<line>For, what we know mu&#383;t be, and is as common</line>
<line>As any the mo&#383;t vulgar thing to &#383;ence,</line>
<line>Why &#383;hould we in our peeui&#383;h Oppo&#383;ition</line>
<line>Take it to heart? Fye, &#8217;tis a fault to Heauen,</line>
<line>A fault again&#383;t the Dead, a fault to Nature,</line>
<line>To Rea&#383;on mo&#383;t ab&#383;urd, who&#383;e common Theame</line>
<line>Is death of Fathers, and who &#383;till hath cried,</line>
<line>From the fir&#383;t Coar&#383;e, till he that dyed to day,</line>
<line>This mu&#383;t be &#383;o. We pray you throw to earth</line>
<line>This vnpreuayling w&#339;, and thinke of vs</line>
<line>As of a Father; For let the world take note,</line>
<line>You are the mo&#383;t immediate to our Throne,</line>
<line>And with no le&#383;&#383;e Nobility of Loue,</line>
<line>Then that which deere&#383;t Father beares his Sonne,</line>
<line>Do I impart towards you. For your intent</line>
<line>In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,</line>
<line>It is mo&#383;t retrograde to our de&#383;ire:</line>

<line>And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;</line>
<line>He rais&#8217;d a &#383;igh, &#383;o pittious and profound,</line>
<line>That it did &#383;eeme to &#383;hatter all his bulke,</line>
<line>And end his being. That done, he lets me g&#339;,</line>

<line>It &#383;eemes it is as proper to our Age,</line>
<line>To ca&#383;t beyond our &#383;elues in our Opinions,</line>
<line>As it is common for the yonger &#383;ort</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>Neither my Lord.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>Then you liue about her wa&#383;te, or in the mid-</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Guil.</speaker>
<line>Faith, her priuates, we.</line>

<line>None my Lord; but that the World&#8217;s growne</line>
<line>hone&#383;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>Then is Doome&#383;day neere: But your newes is</line>
<line>not true. Let me que&#383;tion more in particular: what haue</line>
<line>you my good friends, de&#383;erued at the hands of Fortune,</line>
<line>that &#383;he &#383;ends you to Pri&#383;on hither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Guil.</speaker>
<line>Pri&#383;on, my Lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>Denmark&#8217;s a Pri&#383;on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>Then is the World one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>We thinke not &#383;o my Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>Why then &#8217;tis none to you; for there is nothing</line>
<line>either good or bad, but thinking makes it &#383;o: to me it is</line>
<line>a pri&#383;on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>Why then your Ambition makes it one: &#8217;tis</line>
<line>too narrow for your minde.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>O God, I could be bounded in a nut&#383;hell, and</line>
<line>count my &#383;elfe a King of infinite &#383;pace; were it not that</line>
<line>I haue bad dreames.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Guil.</speaker>
<line>Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the</line>
<line>very &#383;ub&#383;tance of the Ambitious, is meerely the &#383;hadow</line>
<line>of a Dreame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>A dreame it &#383;elfe is but a &#383;hadow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>Truely, and I hold Ambition of &#383;o ayry and</line>
<line>light a quality, that it is but a &#383;hadowes &#383;hadow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Mo-</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>No &#383;uch matter. I will not &#383;ort you with the</line>

<speaker>Ro&#383;in.</speaker>
<line>To what end my Lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>That you mu&#383;t teach me: but let mee coniure</line>
<line>you by the rights of our fellow&#383;hip, by the con&#383;onancy of</line>
<line>our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-pre&#383;erued loue,</line>
<line>and by what more deare, a better propo&#383;er could charge</line>

<line>Is it not mon&#383;trous that this Player heere,</line>
<line>But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Pa&#383;&#383;ion,</line>
<line>Could force his &#383;oule &#383;o to his whole conceit,</line>

<line>Teares in his eyes, di&#383;tra&#392;tion in&#8217;s A&#383;pe&#392;t,</line>
<line>A broken voyce, and his whole Fun&#392;tion &#383;uiting</line>
<line>With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?</line>
<line>For <nameref>Hecuba</nameref>?</line>
<line>What&#8217;s <nameref>Hecuba</nameref> to him, or he to <nameref>Hecuba</nameref>,</line>
<line>That he &#383;hould weepe for her? What would he d&#339;,</line>
<line>Had he the Motiue and the Cue for pa&#383;&#383;ion</line>
<line>That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,</line>
<line>And cleaue the generall eare with horrid &#383;peech:</line>
<line>Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,</line>
<line>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,</line>
<line>The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,</line>
<line>A dull and muddy-metled Ra&#383;call, peake</line>
<line>Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cau&#383;e,</line>
<line>And can &#383;ay nothing: No, not for a King,</line>
<line>Vpon who&#383;e property, and mo&#383;t deere life,</line>
<line>A damn&#8217;d defeate was made. Am I a Coward?</line>
<line>Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-cro&#383;&#383;e?</line>
<line>Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?</line>
<line>Tweakes me by&#8217;th&#8217;No&#383;e? giues me the Lye i&#8217;th&#8217;Throate,</line>
<line>As deepe as to the Lungs? Who d&#339;s me this?</line>
<line>Ha? Why I &#383;hould take it: for it cannot be,</line>
<line>But I am Pigeon-Liuer&#8217;d, and lacke Gall</line>
<line>To make Oppre&#383;&#383;ion bitter, or ere this,</line>
<line>I &#383;hould haue fatted all the Region Kites</line>
<line>With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,</line>
<line>Remor&#383;ele&#383;&#383;e, Treacherous,Letcherous, kindles villaine!</line>
<line>Oh Vengeance!</line>
<line>Who? What an A&#383;&#383;e am I? I &#383;ure, this is mo&#383;t braue,</line>
<line>That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,</line>
<line>Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,</line>
<line>And fall a Cur&#383;ing like a very Drab.</line>
<line>A Scullion? Fye vpon&#8217;t: Foh. About my Braine.</line>
<line>I haue heard, that guilty Creatures &#383;itting at a Play,</line>
<line>Haue by the very cunning of the Sc&#339;ne,</line>
<line>Bene &#383;trooke &#383;o to the &#383;oule, that pre&#383;ently</line>
<line>They haue proclaim&#8217;d their Malefa&#392;tions.</line>
<line>For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will &#383;peake</line>
<line>With mo&#383;t myraculous Organ. Ile haue the&#383;e Players,</line>
<line>Play &#383;omething like the murder of my Father,</line>
<line>Before mine Vnkle. Ile ob&#383;erue his lookes,</line>
<line>Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench</line>
<line>I know my cour&#383;e. The Spirit that I haue &#383;eene</line>
<line>May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power</line>
<line>T&#8217;a&#383;&#383;ume a plea&#383;ing &#383;hape, yea and perhaps</line>
<line>Out of my Weakne&#383;&#383;e, and my Melancholly,</line>
<line>As he is very potent with &#383;uch Spirits,</line>
<line>Abu&#383;es me to damne me. Ile haue grounds</line>

<line>To be, or not to be, that is the Que&#383;tion:</line>

<line>The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,</line>
<line>Or to take Armes again&#383;t a Sea of troubles,</line>
<line>And by oppo&#383;ing end them: to dye, to &#383;leepe</line>
<line>No more; and by a &#383;leepe, to &#383;ay we end</line>
<line>The Heart-ake, and the thou&#383;and Naturall &#383;hockes</line>
<line>That Fle&#383;h is heyre too? &#8217;Tis a con&#383;ummation</line>
<line>Deuoutly to be wi&#383;h&#8217;d. To dye to &#383;leepe,</line>
<line>To &#383;leepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there&#8217;s the rub,</line>
<line>For in that &#383;leepe of death, what dreames may come,</line>
<line>When we haue &#383;huffel&#8217;d off this mortall coile,</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t giue vs paw&#383;e. There&#8217;s the re&#383;pe&#392;t</line>
<line>That makes Calamity of &#383;o long life:</line>
<line>For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,</line>
<line>The Oppre&#383;&#383;ors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,</line>
<line>The pangs of di&#383;priz&#8217;d Loue, the Lawes delay,</line>
<line>The in&#383;olence of Office, and the Spurnes</line>
<line>That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,</line>
<line>When he him&#383;elfe might his <italic>Quietus</italic> make</line>
<line>With a bare Bodkin? Who would the&#383;e Fardles beare</line>
<line>To grunt and &#383;weat vnder a weary life,</line>
<line>But that the dread of &#383;omething after death,</line>
<line>The vndi&#383;couered Countrey, from who&#383;e Borne</line>
<line>No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,</line>
<line>And makes vs rather beare tho&#383;e illes we haue,</line>
<line>Then flye to others that we know not of.</line>
<line>Thus Con&#383;cience d&#339;s make Cowards of vs all,</line>
<line>And thus the Natiue hew of Re&#383;olution</line>
<line>Is &#383;icklied o&#8217;re, with the pale ca&#383;t of Thought,</line>
<line>And enterprizes of great pith and moment,</line>

<line>As made the things more rich, then perfume left:</line>
<line>Take the&#383;e againe, for to the Noble minde</line>

<speaker>Ophe.</speaker>
<line>Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce</line>
<line>then your Hone&#383;tie?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will &#383;ooner</line>
<line>tran&#383;forme Hone&#383;tie from what is, to a Bawd, then the</line>
<line>force of Hone&#383;tie can tran&#383;late Beautie into his likene&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>This was &#383;ometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it</line>
<line>proofe. I did loue you once.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ophe.</speaker>
<line>Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ham.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;hould not haue beleeued me. For vertue</line>
<line>cannot &#383;o innocculate our old &#383;tocke, but we &#383;hall relli&#383;h</line>

<line>uengefull, Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,</line>
<line>then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue</line>
<line>them &#383;hape, or time to a&#392;te them in. What &#383;hould &#383;uch</line>

<line>Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:</line>
<line>for Wi&#383;e men know well enough, what mon&#383;ters you</line>
<line>make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Far-</line>

<line>Gods creatures, and make your Wantonne&#383;&#383;e, your Ig-</line>

<line>Who dipping all his Faults in their affe&#392;tion,</line>
