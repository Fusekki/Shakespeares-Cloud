<line>The Peeres agreed, and <nameref>Henry</nameref> was well pleas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To change two Dukedomes for a Dukes faire daughter.</line>
<line>I cannot blame them all, what is&#8217;t to them?</line>

<line>So &#383;hall my name with Slanders tongue be wounded,</line>
<line>And Princes Courts be &#64257;ll&#8217;d with my reproach:</line>

<line>Or turne our Sterne vpon a dreadfull Rocke:</line>
<line>Yet &#198;olus would not be a murtherer,</line>
<line>But left that hatefull of&#64257;ce vnto thee.</line>
<line>The pretty vaulting Sea refus&#8217;d to drowne me,</line>
<line>Knowing that thou would&#383;t haue me drown&#8217;d on &#383;hore</line>

<line>Aged contu&#383;ions, and all bru&#383;h of Time:</line>
<line>And like a Gallant, in the brow of youth,</line>
