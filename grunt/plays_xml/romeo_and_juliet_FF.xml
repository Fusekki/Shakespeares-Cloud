<line>ger then Agat-&#383;tone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman,</line> 
<line>drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens no&#383;es as</line> 
<line>they lie a&#383;leepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spin-</line>
<line>ners legs: the Couer of the wings of Gra&#383;hoppers, her</line> 
<line>Traces of the &#383;malle&#383;t Spiders web, her coullers of the</line> 
<line>Moon&#383;hines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,</line> 
<line>the La&#383;h of Philome, her Waggoner, a &#383;mall gray-coated</line> 
<line>Gnat, not halfe &#383;o bigge as a round little Worme, prickt</line> 
<line>from the Lazie-finger of a man. Her Chariot is an emptie</line> 
<line>Ha&#383;elnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time</line> 
<line>out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: &#38; in this &#383;tate &#383;he</line> 
<line>gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then</line>

<line>Fees, ore Ladies lips, who &#383;trait on ki&#383;&#383;es dreame, which</line> 
<line>oft the angry Mab with bli&#383;ters plagues, becau&#383;e their</line> 
<line>breath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime &#383;he gal-</line>
<line>lops ore a Courtiers no&#383;e, &#38; then dreames he of &#383;melling</line> 
<line>out a &#383;ute: &#38; &#383;omtime comes &#383;he with Tith pigs tale, tick-</line>
<line>ling a Par&#383;ons no&#383;e as a lies a&#383;leepe, then he dreames of</line> 
<line>another Benefice. Sometime &#383;he driueth ore a Souldiers</line>

<line>Breaches, Ambu&#383;cados, Spani&#383;h Blades: Of Healths fiue</line> 
<line>Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which</line> 
<line>he &#383;tartes and wakes; and being thus frighted, &#383;weares a</line> 
<line>prayer or two &#38; &#383;leepes againe: this is that very Mab that</line> 
<line>plats the manes of Hor&#383;es in the night: &#38; bakes the Elk-</line>
<line>locks in foule &#383;lutti&#383;h haires, which once vntangled, much</line> 
<line>misfortune bodes.</line>
<line>This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,</line>

<line>And more incon&#383;tant then the wind, who wooes</line>
<line>Euen now the frozen bo&#383;ome of the North:</line>
<line>And being anger&#8217;d, puffes away from thence,</line>

<line>Could not take truce with the vnruly &#383;pleene</line>

<line>Who all as hot, turnes deadly point to point,</line>

<line>Cold death a&#383;ide, and with the other &#383;ends</line>
<line>It back to <nameref>Tybalt</nameref>, who&#383;e dexterity</line>
<line>Retorts it: <nameref>Romeo</nameref> he cries aloud,</line>
<line>Hold Friends, Friends part, and &#383;wifter then his tongue,</line>
<line>His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points,</line>
<line>And twixt them ru&#383;hes, vnderneath who&#383;e arme,</line>
<line>An enuious thru&#383;t from <nameref>Tybalt</nameref>, hit the life</line>

<line>You, to remoue that &#383;iege of Greefe from her,</line>
<line>Betroth&#8217;d, and would haue married her perforce</line>
<line>To Countie <nameref>Paris</nameref>. Then comes &#383;he to me,</line>
<line>And (with wilde lookes) bid me deui&#383;e &#383;ome meanes</line>
<line>To rid her from this &#383;econd Marriage,</line>
<line>Or in my Cell there would &#383;he kill her &#383;elfe.</line>
<line>Then gaue I her (so Tutor&#8217;d by my Art)</line>
<line>A &#383;leeping Potion, which &#383;o tooke effe&#392;t</line>
<line>As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
<line>The forme of death. Meane time, I writ to <nameref>Romeo</nameref>,</line>

<line>To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,</line>
<line>Being the time the Potions force &#383;hould cea&#383;e.</line>

<line>Was &#383;tay&#8217;d by accident; and ye&#383;ternight</line>
<line>Return&#8217;d my Letter backe. Then all alone,</line>
<line>At the prefixed houre of her waking,</line>

<line>Meaning to keepe her clo&#383;ely at my Cell,</line>
<line>Till I conueniently could &#383;end to <nameref>Romeo</nameref>.</line>

<line>Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay</line>
<line>The Noble <nameref>Paris</nameref>, and true <nameref>Romeo</nameref> dead.</line>
<line>Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,</line>
<line>And beare this worke of Heauen, with patience:</line>
<line>But then, a noy&#383;e did &#383;carre me from the Tombe,</line>
<line>And &#383;he (too de&#383;perate) would not go with me,</line>
<line>But (as it &#383;eemes) did violence on her &#383;elfe.</line>
<line>All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nur&#383;e is priuy:</line>
<line>And if ought in this mi&#383;carried by my fault,</line>
<line>Let my old life be &#383;acrific&#8217;d, &#383;ome houre before the time,</line>
<line>Vnto the rigour of &#383;euere&#383;t Law.</line>
