<div class="line">Keep him out.</div>

<div class="speech">

<div class="speech">
<div class="speaker">PAR.</div>
<div class="line">There is none. Man, setting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.</div>

<div class="line">Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?</div>
</div>
<div class="speech">
<div class="speaker">PAR.</div>
<div class="line">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. &#8217;Tis too cold a companion; away with&#8217;t!</div>
</div>

<div class="speaker">HEL.</div>
<div class="line">I will stand for&#8217;t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</div>

<div class="speech">
<div class="speaker">PAR.</div>
<div class="line">There&#8217;s little can be said in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t! Within t&#8217; one year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with&#8217;t!</div>

<div class="speech">
<div class="speaker">HEL.</div>
<div class="line">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</div>

<div class="line">Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne&#8217;er it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying: the longer kept, the less worth. Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable&#8212;just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither&#8217;d pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear; it was formerly better, marry, yet &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear.

Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.</div>
