<line>And for what cau&#383;e thou cam&#8217;&#383;t to <nameref>Ephe&#383;us</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mer.</speaker>
<line>A heauier taske could not haue beene impos&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Then I to &#383;peake my griefes vn&#383;peakeable:</line>
<line>Yet that the world may witne&#383;&#383;e that my end</line>
<line>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</line>
<line>Ile vtter what my &#383;orrow giues me leaue.</line>
<line>In <nameref>Syracu&#383;a</nameref> was I borne, and wedde</line>
<line>Vnto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line>And by me; had not our hap beene bad:</line>
<line>With her I liu&#8217;d in ioy, our wealth increa&#383;t</line>
<line>By pro&#383;perous voyages I often made</line>
<line>To <nameref>Epidamium</nameref>, till my fa&#392;tors death,</line>
<line>And he great care of goods at randone left,</line>
<line>Drew me from kinde embracements of my &#383;pou&#383;e;</line>
<line>From whom my ab&#383;ence was not &#383;ixe moneths olde,</line>
<line>Before her &#383;elfe (almo&#383;t at fainting vnder</line>
<line>The plea&#383;ing puni&#383;hment that women beare)</line>
<line>Had made proui&#383;ion for her following me,</line>
<line>And &#383;oone, and &#383;afe, arriued where I was:</line>
<line>There had &#383;he not beene long, but &#383;he became</line>
<line>A ioyfull mother of two goodly &#383;onnes:</line>
<line>And, which was &#383;trange, the one &#383;o like the other,</line>
<line>As could not be distingui&#383;h&#8217;d but by names.</line>
<line>That very howre, and in the &#383;elfe-&#383;ame Inne,</line>
<line>A meane woman was deliuered</line>
<line>Of &#383;uch a burthen Male, twins both alike:</line> 
<line>Tho&#383;e, for their parents were exceeding poore,</line>
<line>I bought, and brought vp to attend my &#383;onnes.</line>
<line>My wife, not meanely prowd of two &#383;uch boyes,</line>
<line>Made daily motions for our home returne:</line>
<line>Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too &#383;oone wee came aboord.</line>
<line>A league from <nameref>Epidamium</nameref> had we &#383;aild</line>
<line>Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe</line>
<line>Gaue any Tragicke In&#383;tance of our harme:</line>
<line>But longer did we not retaine much hope;</line>
<line>For what ob&#383;cured light the heauens did grant,</line>
<line>Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes</line>
<line>A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,</line>
<line>Which though my &#383;elfe would gladly haue imbrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Yet the ince&#383;&#383;ant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line>Weeping before for what &#383;he &#383;aw mu&#383;t come,</line>
<line>And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes</line>
<line>That mourn&#8217;d for fa&#383;hion, ignorant what to feare,</line>
<line>For&#383;t me to &#383;eeke delayes for them and me,</line>
<line>And this it was: (for other meanes was none)</line>
<line>The Sailors &#383;ought for &#383;afety by our boate,</line>
<line>And left the &#383;hip then &#383;inking ripe to vs.</line>
<line>My wife, more carefull for the latter borne,</line>
<line>Had fa&#383;tned him vnto a &#383;mall &#383;pare Ma&#383;t,</line>
<line>Such as &#383;ea-faring men prouide for &#383;tormes:</line>
<line>To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line>Whil&#8217;&#383;t I had beene like heedfull of the other.</line>
<line>The children thus di&#383;pos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</line>
<line>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,</line>
<line>Fa&#383;tned our &#383;elues at eyther end the ma&#383;t,</line>
<line>And floating &#383;traight, obedient to the &#383;treame,</line>
<line>Was carried towards <nameref>Corinth</nameref>, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length the &#383;onne gazing vpon the earth,</line>
<line>Di&#383;per&#383;t tho&#383;e vapours that offended vs,</line>
<line>And by the benefit of his wi&#383;hed light</line>
<line>The &#383;eas waxt calme, and we di&#383;couered</line>
<line>Two &#383;hippes from farre, making amaine to vs:</line>
<line>Of <nameref>Corinth</nameref> that, of <nameref>Epidarm</nameref> this,</line>
<line>But ere they came, oh let me &#383;ay no more,</line>
<line>Gather the &#383;equell by that went before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>Nay forward old man, d&#339; not breake off &#383;o,</line>
<line>For we may pitty, though not pardon thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Merch.</speaker>
<line>Oh had the gods done &#383;o, I had not now</line>
<line>Worthily tearm&#8217;d them mercile&#383;&#383;e to vs:</line>
<line>For ere the &#383;hips could meet by twice fiue leagues,</line>
<line>We were encountred by a mighty rocke,</line>
<line>Which being violently borne vp,</line>
<line>Our helpefull &#383;hip was &#383;plitted in the mid&#383;t;</line>
<line>So that in this vniu&#383;t diuorce of vs,</line>
<line>Fortune had left to both of vs alike,</line>
<line>What to delight in, what to &#383;orrow for,</line>
<line>Her part, poore &#383;oule, &#383;eeming as burdened</line>
<line>With le&#383;&#383;er waight, but not with le&#383;&#383;er w&#339;,</line>
<line>Was carried with more &#383;peed before the winde,</line>
<line>And in our &#383;ight they three were taken vp</line>
<line>By Fi&#383;hermen of <nameref>Corinth</nameref>, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length another &#383;hip had &#383;eiz&#8217;d on vs,</line>
<line>And knowing whom it was their hap to &#383;aue,</line>
<line>Gaue healthfull welcome to their &#383;hip-wrackt gue&#383;ts,</line>
<line>And would haue reft the Fi&#383;hers of their prey,</line>
<line>Had not their backe beene very &#383;low of &#383;aile;</line>
<line>And therefore homeward did they bend their cour&#383;e.</line>
<line>Thus haue you heard me &#383;euer&#8217;d from my bli&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</line>

<line>This woman lock&#8217;d me out this day from dinner;</line>
<line>That Gold&#383;mith there, were he not pack&#8217;d with her,</line>
<line>Could witne&#383;&#383;e it: for he was with me then,</line>
<line>Who parted with me to go fetch a Chaine,</line>
<line>Promi&#383;ing to bring it to the Porpentine,</line>
<line>Where <nameref>Baltha&#383;ar</nameref> and I did dine together.</line>
<line>Our dinner done, and he not comming thither,</line>

<line>There did this periur&#8217;d Gold&#383;mith &#383;weare me downe,</line>

<line>Which God he knowes, I &#383;aw not. For the which,</line>
<line>He did arre&#383;t me with an Officer.</line>
<line>I did obey, and &#383;ent my Pe&#383;ant home</line>
<line>For certaine Duckets: he with none return&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Then fairely I be&#383;poke the Officer</line>
<line>To go in per&#383;on with me to my hou&#383;e.</line>
<line>By th&#8217; way, we met my wife, her &#383;i&#383;ter, and a rabble more</line>
<line>Of vilde Confederates: Along with them</line>
<line>They brought one <nameref>Pinch</nameref>, a hungry leane-fac&#8217;d Villaine;</line>
<line>A meere Anatomie, a Mountebanke,</line>
<line>A thred-bare Iugler, and a Fortune-teller,</line>
<line>A needy-hollow-ey&#8217;d-&#383;harpe-looking-wretch;</line>
<line>A liuing dead man. This pernicious &#383;laue,</line>

<line>And with no-face (as &#8217;twere) out-facing me,</line>
<line>Cries out, I was po&#383;&#383;e&#383;t. Then altogether</line>
<line>They fell vpon me, bound me, bore me thence,</line>
<line>And in a darke and danki&#383;h vault at home</line>
<line>There left me and my man, both bound together,</line>
<line>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in &#383;under,</line>
<line>I gain&#8217;d my freedome; and immediately</line>
<line>Ran hether to your Grace, whom I be&#383;eech</line>
