<line order="second">That thou (<nameref>Iago</nameref>) who ha&#383;t had my pur&#383;e,</line>
<line order="third">As if &#253; &#383;trings were thine, &#383;hould&#8217;&#383;t know of this.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ia.</speaker>
<line>But you&#8217;l not heare me. If euer I did dream</line>
<line>Of &#383;uch a matter, abhorre me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rodo.</speaker>
<line>Thou told&#8217;&#383;t me,</line>
<line>Thou did&#8217;&#383;t hold him in thy hate.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>De&#383;pi&#383;e me</line>
<line>If I do not. Three Great-ones of the Cittie,</line>
<line>(In per&#383;onall &#383;uite to make me his Lieutenant)</line>
<line>Off-capt to him: and by the faith of man</line>
<line>I know my price, I am worth no wor&#383;&#383;e a place.</line>
<line>But he (as louing his owne pride, and purpo&#383;es)</line>
<line>Euades them, with a bumba&#383;t Circum&#383;tance,</line>
<line>Horribly &#383;tufft with Epithites of warre,</line>
<line>Non-&#383;uites my Mediators. For certes, &#383;aies he,</line>
<line>I haue already cho&#383;e my Officer. And what was he?</line>
<line>For-&#383;ooth, a great Arithmatician,</line>
<line>One <nameref>Michaell Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref>, a <nameref>Florentine</nameref>,</line>
<line>(A Fellow almo&#383;t damn&#8217;d in a faire Wife)</line>
<line>That neuer &#383;et a Squadron in the Field,</line>
<line>Nor the deui&#383;ion of a Battaile knowes</line>
<line>More then a Spin&#383;ter. Vnle&#383;&#383;e the Booki&#383;h Theoricke:</line>
<line>Wherein the Tongued Con&#383;uls can propo&#383;e</line>
<line>As Ma&#383;terly as he. Meere pratle (without pra&#392;ti&#383;e)</line>
<line>Is all his Souldier&#383;hip. But he (Sir) had th&#8217; ele&#392;tion;</line>
<line>And I (of whom his eies had &#383;eene the proofe</line>
<line>At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds</line>
<line>Chri&#383;ten&#8217;d, and Heathen) mu&#383;t be be-leed, and calm&#8217;d</line>
<line>By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-ca&#383;ter,</line>
<line>He (in good time) mu&#383;t his Lieutenant be,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<line>By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>Why, there&#8217;s no remedie.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis the cur&#383;&#383;e of Seruice;</line>
<line>Preferment goes by Letter, and affe&#392;tion,</line>
<line>And not by old gradation, where each &#383;econd</line>
<line>Stood Heire to&#8217;th&#8217; fir&#383;t. Now Sir, be iudge your &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Whether I in any iu&#383;t terme am Affin&#8217;d</line>
<line>To loue the <nameref>Moore</nameref>?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<line>I would not follow him then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>O Sir content you.</line>
<line>I follow him, to &#383;erue my turne vpon him.</line>
<line>We cannot all be Ma&#383;ters, nor all Ma&#383;ters</line>
<line>Cannot be truely follow&#8217;d. You &#383;hall marke</line>
<line>Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;</line>
<line>That (doting on his owne ob&#383;equious bondage)</line>
<line>Weares out his time, much like his Ma&#383;ters A&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>For naught but Prouender, &#38; when he&#8217;s old Ca&#383;heer&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Whip me &#383;uch hone&#383;t knaues. Others there are</line>
<line>Who trym&#8217;d in Formes, and vi&#383;ages of Dutie,</line>
<line>Keepe yet their hearts attending on them&#383;elues,</line>
<line>And throwing but &#383;howes of Seruice on their Lords</line>
<line>Doe well thriue by them.</line>
<line>And when they haue lin&#8217;d their Coates</line>
<line>Doe them&#383;elues Homage.</line>
<line>The&#383;e Fellowes haue &#383;ome &#383;oule,</line>
<line>And &#383;uch a one do I profe&#383;&#383;e my &#383;elfe. For (Sir)</line>
<line>It is as &#383;ure as you are <nameref>Rodorigo</nameref>,</line>
<line>Were I the Moore, I would not be <nameref>Iago</nameref>:</line>
<line>In following him, I follow but my &#383;elfe.</line>
<line>Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,</line>
<line>But &#383;eeming &#383;o, for my peculiar end:</line>
<line>For when my outward A&#392;tion doth demon&#383;trate</line>
<line>The natiue a&#392;t, and figure of my heart</line>
<line>In Complement externe, &#8216;tis not long after</line>
<line>But I will weare my heart vpon my &#383;leeue</line>

<line>The verie head, and front of my offending,</line>
<line>Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my &#383;peech,</line>

<line>More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,</line>
<line>And therefore little &#383;hall I grace my cau&#383;e,</line>
<line>In &#383;peaking for my &#383;elfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)</line>

<line>Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing</line>
<line>To fall in Loue, with what &#383;he fear&#8217;d to looke on;</line>
<line>It is a iudgement main&#8217;d, and mo&#383;t imperfe&#392;t.</line>
<line>That will confe&#383;&#383;e Perfe&#392;tion &#383;o could erre</line>

<line>To find out pra&#392;ti&#383;es of cunning hell</line>

<line>Or with &#383;ome Dram, (coniur&#8217;d to this effe&#392;t)</line>

<line>Of being taken by the In&#383;olent Foe,</line>

<line>Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, who&#383;e head touch heauen,</line>

<line>Would <nameref>De&#383;demona</nameref> &#383;eriou&#383;ly incline:</line>
<line>But &#383;till the hou&#383;e Affaires would draw her hence:</line>
<line>Which euer as &#383;he could with ha&#383;te di&#383;patch,</line>
<line>She&#8217;l&#8217;d come againe, and with a greedie eare</line>
<line>Deuoure vp my di&#383;cour&#383;e. Which I ob&#383;eruing,</line>
<line>Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes</line>
<line>To draw from her a prayer of earne&#383;t heart,</line>
<line>That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,</line>
<line>Whereof by parcels &#383;he had &#383;omething heard,</line>

<line>I would keepe from thee. For your &#383;ake (Iewell)</line>
<line>I am glad at &#383;oule, I haue no other Child,</line>

<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Let me &#383;peake like your &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>And lay a Sentence,</line>
<line>Which as a gri&#383;e, or &#383;tep may helpe the&#383;e Louers.</line>
<line>When remedies are pa&#383;t, the griefes are ended</line>
<line>By &#383;eeing the wor&#383;t, which late on hopes depended.</line>
<line>To mourne a Mi&#383;cheefe that is pa&#383;t and gon,</line>
<line>Is the next way to draw new mi&#383;chiefe on.</line>
<line>What cannot be pre&#383;eru&#8217;d, when Fortune takes:</line>
<line>Patience, her Iniury a mock&#8217;ry makes.</line>
<line>The rob&#8217;d that &#383;miles, &#383;teales &#383;omething from the Thiefe,</line>
<line>He robs him&#383;elfe, that &#383;pends a bootele&#383;&#383;e griefe.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Bra.</speaker>
<line>So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,</line>
<line>We loo&#383;e it not &#383;o long as we can &#383;mile:</line>
<line>He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,</line>
<line>But the free comfort which from thence he heares.</line>
<line>But he beares both the Sentence, and the &#383;orrow,</line>
<line>That to pay griefe, mu&#383;t of poore Patience borrow.</line>
<line>The&#383;e Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,</line>
<line>Being &#383;trong on both &#383;ides, are Equiuocall.</line>
<line>But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:</line>
<line>That the bruized heart was pierc&#8217;d through the eares.</line>
<line>I humbly be&#383;eech you proceed to th&#8217; Affaires of State.</line>

<line>for foure times &#383;euen yeares, and &#383;ince I could di&#383;tingui&#383;h</line>
<line>betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that</line>
<line>knew how to loue him&#383;elfe. Ere I would &#383;ay, I would</line>
<line>drowne my &#383;elfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would</line>
<line>change my Humanity with a Baboone.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>Vertue? A figge, &#8216;tis in our &#383;elues that we are</line>
<line>thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,</line>
<line>our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Net-</line>
<line>tels, or &#383;owe Lettice: Set Hi&#383;ope, and weede vp Time:</line>
<line>Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or di&#383;tra&#392;t it with</line>
<line>many: either to haue it &#383;terrill with idlene&#383;&#383;e, or manu-</line>
<line>red with Indu&#383;try, why the power, and Corrigeable au-</line>
<line>thoritie of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues</line>
<line>had not one Scale of Rea&#383;on, to poize another of Sen&#383;u-</line>
<line>alitie, the blood, and ba&#383;ene&#383;&#383;e of our Natures would</line>

<line>Stings, or vnbitted Lu&#383;ts: whereof I take this, that you</line>
<line>call Loue, to be a Se&#392;t, or Seyen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<line>It cannot be.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>It is meerly a Lu&#383;t of the blood, and a permi&#383;&#383;ion</line>
<line>of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy &#383;elfe? Drown</line>
<line>Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profe&#383;t me thy Friend,</line>
<line>and I confe&#383;&#383;e me knit to thy de&#383;eruing, with Cables of</line>
<line>perdurable toughne&#383;&#383;e. I could neuer better &#383;teed thee</line>
<line>then now. Put Money in thy pur&#383;e: follow thou the</line>
<line>Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an v&#383;urp&#8217;d Beard. I &#383;ay</line>
<line>put Money in thy pur&#383;e. It cannot be long that <nameref>De&#383;demona</nameref></line>
<line>&#383;hould continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in</line>
<line>thy pur&#383;e: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commence-</line>
<line>ment in her, and thou &#383;halt &#383;ee an an&#383;werable Seque-</line>
<line>&#383;tration, put but Money in thy pur&#383;e. The&#383;e Moores</line>
<line>are changeable in their wils: fill thy pur&#383;e with Money.</line>
<line>The Food that to him now is as lu&#383;hious as Locu&#383;ts,</line>
<line>&#383;halbe to him &#383;hortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She</line>
<line>mu&#383;t change for youth: when &#383;he is &#383;ated with his body</line>
<line>&#383;he will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Mo-</line>
<line>ney in thy pur&#383;e. If thou wilt needs damne thy &#383;elfe, do</line>
<line>it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Mo-</line>
<line>ney thou can&#383;t: If San&#392;timonie, and a fraile vow, be-</line>
<line>twixt an erring Barbarian, and &#383;uper-&#383;ubtle Venetian be</line>
<line>not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou</line>
<line>&#383;halt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drow-</line>
<line>ning thy &#383;elfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou ra-</line>
<line>ther to be hang&#8217;d in Compa&#383;&#383;ing thy ioy, then to be</line>
<line>drown&#8217;d, and go without her.</line>

<line>Wilt thou be fa&#383;t to my hopes, if I depend on</line>
<line>the i&#383;&#383;ue?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>Thou art &#383;ure of me: Go make Money: I haue</line>
<line>told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I</line>
<line>hate the Moore. My cau&#383;e is hearted; thine hath no le&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>rea&#383;on. Let vs be coniun&#392;tiue in our reuenge, again&#383;t</line>
<line>him. If thou can&#383;t Cuckold him, thou do&#383;t thy &#383;elfe a</line>
<line>plea&#383;ure, me a &#383;port. There are many Euents in the</line>

<line>And he that is approu&#8217;d in this offence,</line>
<line>Though he had twinn&#8217;d with me, both at a birth,</line>
<line>Shall loo&#383;e me. What in a Towne of warre,</line>

<line>To Manage priuate, and dome&#383;ticke Quarrell?</line>
<line>In night, and on the Court and Guard of &#383;afetie?</line>

<line>Touch me not &#383;o neere,</line>
<line>I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,</line>

<line>Yet I per&#383;wade my &#383;elfe, to &#383;peake the truth</line>
<line>Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:</line>
<line><nameref>Montano</nameref> and my &#383;elfe being in &#383;peech,</line>
<line>There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,</line>
<line>And <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref> following him with determin&#8217;d Sword</line>
<line>To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,</line>
<line>Steppes in to <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref>, and entreats his pau&#383;e:</line>
<line>My &#383;elfe, the crying Fellow did pur&#383;ue,</line>
<line>Lea&#383;t by his clamour (as it &#383;o fell out)</line>
<line>The Towne might fall in fright. He, (&#383;wift of foote)</line>
<line>Out-ran my purpo&#383;e: and I return&#8217;d then rather</line>
<line>For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,</line>
<line>And <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref> high in oath: Which till to night</line>

<line>At blow, and thru&#383;t, euen as againe they were</line>
<line>When you your &#383;elfe did part them.</line>
<line>More of this matter cannot I report,</line>
<line>But Men are Men: The be&#383;t &#383;ometimes forget,</line>
<line>Though <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref> did &#383;ome little wrong to him,</line>
<line>As men in rage &#383;trike tho&#383;e that wi&#383;h them be&#383;t,</line>
<line>Yet &#383;urely <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref>, I beleeue receiu&#8217;d</line>

<line>Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye</line>
<line>Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits &#383;hould hunt</line>
<line>After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,</line>
<line>And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu&#8217;d)</line>
<line>To giue it her. I did &#383;o; and take heede on&#8217;t,</line>

<line>I thinke it is: and doth Affe&#392;tion breed it?</line>
<line>I thinke it doth. Is&#8217;t Frailty that thus erres?</line>
<line>It is &#383;o too. And haue not we Affe&#392;tions?</line>
