<line>He would not take it: neuer did I know</line>
<line>A creature that did beare the &#383;hape of man</line>
<line>So keene and greedy to confound a man.</line>
<line>He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,</line>
<line>And doth impeach the freedome of the &#383;tate</line>
<line>If they deny him iu&#383;tice. Twenty Merchants,</line>

<line>Of greate&#383;t port haue all per&#383;waded with him,</line>

<line>Of a &#383;trange nature is the &#383;ute you follow,</line>

<line>Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.</line>
<line>You &#383;tand within his danger, do you not?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<line>The quality of mercy is not &#383;train&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen</line>
<line>Vpon the place beneath. It is twice ble&#383;t,</line>
<line>It ble&#383;&#383;eth him that giues, and him that takes,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis mightie&#383;t in the mightie&#383;t, it becomes</line>
<line>The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.</line>
<line>His Scepter &#383;hewes the force of temporall power,</line>
<line>The attribute to awe and Maie&#383;tie,</line>
<line>Wherein doth &#383;it the dread and feare of Kings:</line>
<line>But mercy is aboue this &#383;ceptred &#383;way,</line>
<line>It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,</line>
<line>It is an attribute to God him&#383;elfe;</line>
<line>And earthly power doth then &#383;hew like&#383;t Gods</line>
<line>When mercie &#383;ea&#383;ons Iu&#383;tice. Therefore Iew,</line>
<line>Though Iu&#383;tice be thy plea, con&#383;ider this,</line>
<line>That in the cour&#383;e of Iu&#383;tice, none of vs</line>
<line>Should &#383;ee &#383;aluation: we do pray for mercie,</line>
<line>And that &#383;ame prayer, doth teach vs all to render</line>
<line>The deeds of mercie. I haue &#383;poke thus much</line>
<line>To mittigate the iu&#383;tice of thy plea:</line>
<line>Which if thou follow, this &#383;tri&#392;t cour&#383;e of Venice</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t needes giue &#383;entence &#8217;gain&#383;t the Merchant there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Shy.</speaker>
<line>My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,</line>

<line>Is he not able to di&#383;charge the money?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ba&#383;.</speaker>
<line>Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,</line>
<line>Yea, twice the &#383;umme, if that will not &#383;uf&#64257;ce,</line>
<line>I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,</line>
<line>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:</line>
<line>If this will not &#383;uf&#64257;ce, it mu&#383;t appeare</line>
<line>That malice beares downe truth. And I be&#383;eech you</line>
<line>Wre&#383;t once the Law to your authority.</line>
<line>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</line>
<line>And curbe this cruell diuell of his will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Por.</speaker>
<line>It mu&#383;t not be, there is no power in Venice</line>
<line>Can alter a decree e&#383;tabli&#383;hed:</line>
<line>&#8217;Twill be recorded for a Pre&#383;ident,</line>
<line>And many an error by the &#383;ame example,</line>
