<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>Now Captaine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alc.</speaker>
<line>I am an humble Sutor to your Vertues;</line>
<line>For pitty is the vertue of the Law,</line>
<line>And none but Tyrants v&#383;e it cruelly.</line>
<line>It plea&#383;es time and Fortune to lye heauie</line>
<line>Vpon a Friend of mine, who in hot blood</line>
<line>Hath &#383;tept into the Law: which is pa&#383;t depth</line>
<line>To tho&#383;e that (without heede) do plundge intoo&#8217;t.</line>
<line>He is a Man (&#383;etting his Fate a&#383;ide) of comely Vertues,</line>
<line>Nor did he &#383;oyle the fa&#392;t with Cowardice.</line>
<line>(And Honour in him, which buyes out his fault)</line>
<line>But with a Noble Fury, and faire &#383;pirit,</line>
<line>Seeing his Reputation touch&#8217;d to death,</line>
<line>He did oppo&#383;e his F&#339;:</line>
<line>And with &#383;uch &#383;ober and vnnoted pa&#383;&#383;ion</line>
<line>He did behooue his anger ere &#8217;twas &#383;pent,</line>
<line>As if he had but prou&#8217;d an Argument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Sen.</speaker>
<line>You vndergo too &#383;tri&#392;t a Paradox,</line>
<line>Striuing to make an vgly deed looke faire:</line>
<line>Your words haue tooke &#383;uch paines, as if they labour&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bring Man-&#383;laughter into forme, and &#383;et Quarrelling</line>
<line>Vpon the head of Valour; which indeede</line>
<line>Is Valour mi&#383;-begot, and came into the world,</line>
<line>When Se&#392;ts, and Fa&#392;tions were newly borne.</line>
<line>Hee&#8217;s truly Valiant, that can wi&#383;ely &#383;uffer</line>
<line>The wor&#383;t that man can breath,</line>
<line>And make his Wrongs, his Out-&#383;ides,</line>
<line>To weare them like his Rayment, carele&#383;&#383;ely,</line>
<line>And ne&#8217;re preferre his iniuries to his heart,</line>
<line>To bring it into danger.</line>
<line>If Wrongs be euilles, and inforce vs kill,</line>
<line>What Folly &#8217;tis, to hazard life for Ill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alci.</speaker>
<line>My Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Sen.</speaker>
<line>You cannot make gro&#383;&#383;e &#383;innes looke cleare,</line>
<line>To reuenge is no Valour, but to beare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alci.</speaker>
<line>My Lords, then vnder fauour, pardon me,</line>
<line>If I &#383;peake like a Captaine.</line>
<line>Why do fond men expo&#383;e them&#383;elues to Battell,</line>
<line>And not endure all threats? Sleepe vpon&#8217;t,</line>
<line>And let the F&#339;s quietly cut their Throats</line>
<line>Without repugnancy? If there be</line>
<line>Such Valour in the bearing, what make wee</line>
<line>Abroad? Why then, Women are more valiant</line>
<line>That &#383;tay at home, if Bearing carry it:</line>
<line>And the A&#383;&#383;e, more Captaine then the Lyon?</line>
<line>The fellow loaden with Irons, wi&#383;er then the Iudge?</line>
<line>If Wi&#383;edome be in &#383;uffering. Oh my Lords,</line>
<line>As you are great, be pittifully Good,</line>
<line>Who cannot condemne ra&#383;hne&#383;&#383;e in cold blood?</line>
<line>To kill, I grant, is &#383;innes extreame&#383;t Gu&#383;t,</line>
<line>But in defence, by Mercy, &#8217;tis mo&#383;t iu&#383;t.</line>
<line>To be in Anger, is impietie:</line>
<line>But who is Man, that is not Angrie.</line>
<line>Weigh but the Crime with this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2.Sen.</speaker>
<line>You breath in vaine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alci.</speaker>
<line>In vaine?</line>

<speaker>Alc.</speaker>
<line>Why &#383;ay my Lords ha&#8217;s done faire &#383;eruice,</line>
<line>And &#383;laine in &#64257;ght many of your enemies:</line>
<line>How full of valour did he beare him&#383;elfe</line>
<line>In the la&#383;t Con&#64258;i&#392;t, and made plenteous wounds?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>He has made too much plenty with him:</line>
<line>He&#8217;s a &#383;worne Riotor, he has a &#383;inne</line>
<line>That o&#64261;en drownes him, and takes his valour pri&#383;oner.</line>
<line>If there were no F&#339;s, that were enough</line>
<line>To ouercome him. In that Bea&#383;tly furie,</line>
<line>He has bin knowne to commit outrages,</line>
<line>And cherri&#383;h Fa&#392;tions. &#8217;Tis inferr&#8217;d to vs,</line>
<line>His dayes are foule, and his drinke dangerous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He dyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alci.</speaker>
<line>Hard fate: he might haue dyed in warre.</line>
<line>My Lords, if not for any parts in him,</line>
<line>Though his right arme might purcha&#383;e his owne time,</line>
<line>And be in debt to none: yet more to moue you,</line>
<line>Take my de&#383;erts to his, and ioyne &#8217;em both.</line>
<line>And for I know, your reuerend Ages loue Security,</line>
<line>Ile pawne my Vi&#392;tories, all my Honour to you</line>
<line>Vpon his good returnes.</line>
<line>If by this Crime, he owes the Law his life,</line>
<line>Why let the Warre receiue&#8217;t in valiant gore,</line>
<line>For Law is &#383;tri&#392;t, and Warre is nothing more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>We are for Law, he dyes, vrge it no more</line>
<line>On height of our di&#383;plea&#383;ure: Friend, or Brother,</line>

<line>Obedience fayle in Children: Slaues and Fooles</line>
<line>Plucke the graue wrinkled Senate from the Bench,</line>
<line>And mini&#383;ter in their &#383;teeds, to generall Filthes.</line>
<line>Conuert o&#8217;th&#8217; In&#383;tant greene Virginity,</line>
<line>Doo&#8217;t in your Parents eyes. Bankrupts, hold fa&#383;t</line>
<line>Rather then render backe; out with your Kniues,</line>

<line>And yet Confu&#383;ion liue: Plagues incident to men,</line>
<line>Your potent and infe&#392;tious Feauors, heape</line>
<line>On Athens ripe for &#383;troke. Thou cold Sciatica,</line>
<line>Cripple our Senators, that their limbes may halt</line>
<line>As lamely as their Manners. Lu&#383;t, and Libertie</line>
<line>Creepe in the Mindes and Marrowes of our youth,</line>
<line>That &#8217;gain&#383;t the &#383;treame of Vertue they may &#383;triue,</line>

<line>Be generall Lepro&#383;ie: Breath, infe&#392;t breath,</line>
<line>That their Society (as their Friend&#383;hip) may</line>
