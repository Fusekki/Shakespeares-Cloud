<line><italic>The beauty of this &#383;infull Dame,</italic></line>
<line><italic>Made many princes thither frame,</italic></line>
<line><italic>To &#383;eek her as a bed-fellow,</italic></line>
<line><italic>In marriage plea&#383;ures, play-fellow:</italic></line>
<line><italic>Which to prevent, he made a Law,</italic></line>

<line><italic>That who &#383;o askt her for his wife,</italic></line>
<line><italic>His riddle told not, lo&#383;t his life:</italic></line>

<line>Who finger&#8217;d to make man his lawfull mu&#383;ick,</line>

<line>Great King,</line>
<line>Few love to hear the &#383;ins they love to a&#392;t,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twould braid your &#383;elf too near for me to tell it:</line>
<line>Who hath a book of all that Monarchs do,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s more &#383;ecure to keep it &#383;hut, then &#383;hewn:</line>
<line>For vice repeated, is like the wandring wind,</line>
<line>Blows du&#383;t in others eyes, to &#383;pread it &#383;elf;</line>
<line>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</line>
<line>The breath is gone, and the &#383;ore eyes &#383;ee clear.</line>
<line>To &#383;top the aire would hurt them, the blind Mole ca&#383;t</line>
<line>Copt hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng&#8217;d</line>
<line>By mans oppre&#383;&#383;ion, and the poor worme doth die for&#8217;t.</line>
<line>Kings are earths Gods: in vice their law&#8217;s their will,</line>
<line>And if <nameref>Jove</nameref> &#383;tray, who dares &#383;ay, <nameref>Jove</nameref> doth ill.</line>
<line>It is enough you know it, and &#8217;tis fit;</line>
<line>What being more known, grows wor&#383;e to &#383;mother it.</line>
<line>All love the womb that their Being bred,</line>
<line>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</line>

<line>Heaven that I had it; he has found the meaning,</line>

<line>Blu&#383;h not in a&#392;tions blacker then the night,</line>

<line>Murder&#8217;s as near to lu&#383;t, as flame to &#383;moak.</line>
<line>Poy&#383;on and trea&#383;on are the hands of &#383;in,</line>

<line>In the dayes glorious walk or peacefull night,</line>
<line>The tombe where grief &#383;hould &#383;leep, can breed me quiet,</line>
<line>Here plea&#383;ures court mine eyes, and mine eyes &#383;hun them,</line>
<line>And danger which I fear&#8217;d, is at <nameref>Antioch</nameref>,</line>
<line>Who&#383;e arme &#383;eems far too &#383;hort to hit me here,</line>
<line>Yet neither plea&#383;ures art can joy my &#383;pirits,</line>
<line>Nor yet the others di&#383;tance comfort me:</line>
<line>Then it is thus, the pa&#383;&#383;ions of the mind,</line>
<line>That have their fir&#383;t conception by mi&#383;-dread,</line>
<line>Have after nouri&#383;hment and life by care;</line>
<line>And what was fir&#383;t but fear, what might be done,</line>

<line>Ha, come and bring away the Nets.</line>

<line>Ma&#383;ter, I marvel how the fi&#383;hes live in the Sea?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.</speaker>
<line>Why as men do a Land,</line>
<line>The great ones eat up the little ones:</line> 
<line>I can compare our rich Mi&#383;ers, to nothing &#383;o fitly</line> 
<line>As to a Whale; he plaies and tumbles,</line> 
<line>Driving the poor Fry before him,</line> 
<line>And at la&#383;t devour them all at a mouthfull.</line> 
<line>Such Whales have I heard on a&#8217;th land,</line>

<speaker>3.</speaker>
<line>Becau&#383;e he &#383;hould have &#383;wallowed me too,</line> 
<line>And when I had been in his belly,</line> 
<line>I would have kept &#383;uch a jangling of the bells,</line> 
<line>That he &#383;hould never have left</line> 
<line>Till he ca&#383;&#383;t Bells, Steeple, Church and Pari&#383;h up again:</line>
<line>But if the good King <nameref>Simonides</nameref> were of my mind,</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Per.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Simonides?</nameref></line>
</speech>

<line>We would purge the Land of the&#383;e Drones,</line> 
<line>That rob the Bee of her honny.</line>
</speech>

<line>How from the fenny &#383;ubje&#392;t of the &#383;ea</line>
<line>The&#383;e fi&#383;hers tell the infirmities of men,</line>
<line>And from their watry Empire recolle&#392;t</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>I think you&#8217;ll turn a child again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<line>Were I chief Lord of all this &#383;pacious world,</line>
<line>I&#8217;d give it to undo the deed. O Lady, much le&#383;s in bloud,</line>
<line>then vertue, yet a Prince&#383;s to equall any &#383;ingle Crown of</line>
<line>the earth, in the ju&#383;tice of compare, O villain, <nameref>Leonine</nameref></line>
<line>whom thou ha&#383;t poi&#383;oned too, if thou had&#8217;&#383;t drunk to him,</line>
<line>it had been a kindne&#383;s becoming well thy face, what can&#383;t</line>
<line>thou &#383;ay, when Noble <nameref>Pericles</nameref> &#383;hall demand his child?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>That &#383;he is dead. Nur&#383;es are not the fates to</line>
<line>fo&#383;ter it, nor ever to pre&#383;erve, &#383;he di&#8217;d at night, I&#8217;le &#383;ay</line>
<line>&#383;o, who can cro&#383;&#383;e it, unle&#383;&#383;e you play the Innocent, and</line>
<line>for an hone&#383;t attribute, cry out &#383;he di&#8217;d by foul play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<line>O go too, well, well, of all the faults beneath</line>
<line>the heavens, the gods do like this wor&#383;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>Be one of tho&#383;e that thinks the pretty wrens</line>
<line>of <nameref>Thar&#383;us</nameref> will fly hence, and open this to <nameref>Pericles</nameref>;</line>
<line>I do &#383;hame to think of what Noble &#383;train you are, and</line>
<line>of how coward a &#383;pirit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<line>To &#383;uch proceeding, who ever but his approba-</line>
<line>tion added, though not his whole con&#383;ent, he did not flow</line>
<line>from honorable cour&#383;es.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>Be it &#383;o then, yet none doth know but you</line>
<line>how &#383;he came dead, nor none can know, <nameref>Leonine</nameref> being</line>
<line>gone. She did di&#383;dain my child, and &#383;tood between her</line>
<line>and her fortunes: none would look on her, but ca&#383;t their</line>
<line>gazes on <nameref>Marina&#8217;s</nameref> face, whil&#383;t ours was blurred at, and</line>
<line>held a Mawkin, not worth the time of day. It pierc&#8217;d</line>
<line>me thorow, and though you call my cour&#383;e unnatural,</line>
<line>you not your child well loving, yet I find it greets me as</line>
<line>an enterprize of kindne&#383;s perform&#8217;d to your &#383;ole daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<line>Heavens forgive it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>And as for <nameref>Pericles</nameref>, what &#383;hould he &#383;ay? we</line>
<line>wept after her hear&#383;e, and yet we mourn: her monument</line>
<line>almo&#383;t fini&#383;hed, and her Epitaph in glittering golden</line>
<line>chara&#8217;ters, expre&#383;s a general prai&#383;e to her, and care in us,</line>
<line>at who&#383;e expence &#8217;tis done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
<line>Thou art like the Harpie,</line>
<line>Which to betray, do&#383;t with thy Angels face,</line>
<line>Ceaze with thine Eagles talents.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dion.</speaker>
<line>You are like one, that &#383;uper&#383;titiou&#383;ly</line>
<line>Doth &#383;wear to th&#8217;gods, that winter kills the flies,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mar.</speaker>
