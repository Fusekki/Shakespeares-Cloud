<line>Hath by In&#383;tin&#392;t, knowledge from others Eyes,</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis more then time: And (my mo&#383;t Noble Lord)</line>
<line>I heare for certaine, and do &#383;peake the truth:</line>
<line>The gentle Arch-bi&#383;hop of Yorke is vp</line>
<line>With well appointed Powres: he is a man</line>
<line>Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.</line>
<line>My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,</line>
<line>But &#383;hadowes, and the &#383;hewes of men to &#64257;ght.</line>
<line>For that &#383;ame word (Rebellion) did diuide</line>
<line>The a&#392;tion of their bodies, from their &#383;oules,</line>
<line>And they did &#64257;ght with quea&#383;ine&#383;&#383;e, con&#383;train&#8217;d</line>
<line>As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only</line>

<line>This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,</line>
<line>As Fi&#383;h are in a Pond. But now the Bi&#383;hop</line>
<line>Turnes In&#383;urre&#392;tion to Religion,</line>
<line>Suppos&#8217;d &#383;incere, and holy in his Thoughts:</line>
<line>He&#8217;s follow&#8217;d both with Body, and with Minde:</line>
<line>And doth enlarge his Ri&#383;ing, with the blood</line>
<line>Of faire King <nameref>Richard</nameref>, &#383;crap&#8217;d from Pomfret &#383;tones,</line>
<line>Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cau&#383;e:</line>

<line>Ga&#383;ping for life, vnder great <nameref>Bullingbrooke</nameref>,</line>

<line>Men of all &#383;orts take a pride to gird at mee: the</line>
<line>braine of this fooli&#383;h compounded Clay-man, is not able</line>
<line>to inuent any thing that tends to laughter, more then I</line>
<line>inuent, or is inuented on me. I am not onely witty in my</line>
<line>&#383;elfe, but the cau&#383;e that wit is in other men. I doe heere</line>
<line>walke before thee, like a Sow, that hath o&#8217;rewhelm&#8217;d all</line>
<line>her Litter, but one. If the Prince put thee into my Ser-</line>
<line>uice for any other rea&#383;on, then to &#383;et mee o&#64256;, why then I</line>
<line>haue no iudgement. Thou hor&#383;on Mandrake, thou art</line>

<line>keepe it &#383;till at a Face-Royall, for a Barber &#383;hall neuer</line>
<line>earne &#383;ix pence out of it; and yet he will be crowing, as if</line>
<line>he had writ man euer &#383;ince his Father was a Batchellour.</line>
<line>He may keepe his owne Grace, but he is almo&#383;t out of</line>

<line>weare nothing but high &#383;hoes, and bunches of Keyes at</line>
<line>their girdles: and if a man is through with them in ho-</line>

<line>had as liefe they would put Rats-bane in my mouth, as</line>

<line>Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me &#383;peak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethar-</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>It hath it originall from much greefe; from &#383;tudy</line>
<line>and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cau&#383;e of</line>

<line>Marking, that I am troubled withall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>To puni&#383;h you by the heeles, would amend the</line>
<line>attention of your eares, &amp; I care not if I be your Phy&#383;itian</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>I am as poore as <nameref>Iob</nameref>, my Lord; but not &#383;o Patient:</line>
<line>your Lord&#383;hip may mini&#383;ter the Potion of impri&#383;onment</line>

<line>As I was then adui&#383;ed by my learned Councel, in</line>
<line>the lawes of this Land-&#383;eruice, I did not come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>I would it were otherwi&#383;e: I would my Meanes</line>
<line>were greater, and my wa&#383;te &#383;lenderer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>You haue mi&#383;led the youthfull Prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Well, I am loth to gall a new-heal&#8217;d wound: your</line>
<line>daies &#383;eruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer</line>
<line>your Nights exploit on Gads-hill. You may thanke the</line>

<speaker>Iu&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>But &#383;ince all is wel, keep it &#383;o: wake not a &#383;leeping Wolfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to &#383;mell a Fox.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu.</speaker>
<line>What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Not &#383;o (my Lord) your ill Angell is light: but I</line>
<line>hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without,</line>
<line>weighing: and yet, in &#383;ome re&#383;pe&#392;ts I grant, I cannot go:</line>
<line>I cannot tell. Vertue is of &#383;o little regard in the&#383;e Co&#383;tor-</line>
<line>mongers, that true valor is turn&#8217;d Beare-heard. Pregnan-</line>
<line>cie is made a Tap&#383;ter, and hath his quicke wit wa&#383;ted in</line>
<line>giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man</line>
<line>(as the malice of this Age &#383;hapes them) are not woorth a</line>
<line>Goo&#383;eberry. You that are old, con&#383;ider not the capaci-</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>My Lord, I was borne with a white head, &amp; &#383;om-</line>
<line>thing a round belly. For my voice, I haue lo&#383;t it with hal-</line>
<line>lowing and &#383;inging of Anthemes. To approue my youth</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>I well allow the occa&#383;ion of our Armes,</line>
<line>But gladly would be better &#383;atis&#64257;ed,</line>
<line>How (in our Meanes) we &#383;hould aduance our &#383;elues</line>

<speech>
<speaker>L. Bar.</speaker>
<line>I marry, there&#8217;s the point:</line>
<line>But if without him we be thought to feeble,</line>
<line>My iudgement is, we &#383;hould not &#383;tep too farre</line>
<line>Till we had his A&#383;si&#383;tance by the hand.</line>
<line>For in a Theame &#383;o bloody fac&#8217;d, as this,</line>
<line>Conie&#392;ture, Expe&#392;tation, and Surmi&#383;e</line>
<line>Of Aydes incertaine, &#383;hould not be admitted.</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis very true Lord <nameref>Bardolfe</nameref>, for indeed</line>

<line>Flatt&#8217;ring him&#383;elfe with Proie&#392;t of a power,</line>
<line>Much &#383;maller, then the &#383;malle&#383;t of his Thoughts,</line>
<line>And &#383;o with great imagination</line>
<line>(Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,</line>
<line>And (winking) leap&#8217;d into de&#383;tru&#392;tion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>

<line>Yes, if this pre&#383;ent quality of warre,</line>
<line>Indeed the in&#383;tant a&#392;tion: a cau&#383;e on foot,</line>
<line>Liues &#383;o in hope: As in an early Spring,</line>
<line>We &#383;ee th&#8217; appearing buds, which to proue fruite,</line>
<line>Hope giues not &#383;o much warrant, as Di&#383;paire</line>
<line>That Fro&#383;ts will bite them. When we meane to build,</line>
<line>We &#64257;r&#383;t &#383;uruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,</line>
<line>And when we &#383;ee the &#64257;gure of the hou&#383;e,</line>
<line>Then mu&#383;t we rate the co&#383;t of the Ere&#392;tion,</line>
<line>Which if we &#64257;nde out-weighes Ability,</line>
<line>What do we then, but draw a-new the Modell</line>
<line>In fewer o&#64259;ces? Or at lea&#383;t, de&#383;i&#383;t</line>
<line>To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,</line>
<line>(Which is (almo&#383;t) to plucke a Kingdome downe,</line>
<line>And &#383;et another vp) &#383;hould we &#383;uruey</line>
<line>The plot of Situation, and the Modell;</line>
<line>Con&#383;ent vpon a &#383;ure Foundation:</line>
<line>Que&#383;tion Surueyors, know our owne e&#383;tate,</line>
<line>How able &#383;uch a Worke to vndergo,</line>

<line>We forti&#64257;e in Paper, and in Figures,</line>
<line>V&#383;ing the Names of men, in&#383;tead of men:</line>
<line>Like one, that drawes the Modell of a hou&#383;e</line>
<line>Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)</line>
<line>Giues o&#8217;re, and leaues his part-created Co&#383;t</line>

<line>Name, for you might haue tru&#383;s&#8217;d him and all his Ap-</line>
<line>parrell into an Eele-skinne: the Ca&#383;e of a Treble Hoe-</line>
<line>boy was a Man&#383;ion for him: a Court: and now hath</line>
<line>hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with</line>
<line>him, if I returne: and it &#383;hall goe hard, but I will make</line>
<line>him a Philo&#383;ophers two Stones to me. If the young</line>

<line>But (my mo&#383;t Noble Lord of We&#383;tmerland)</line>

<line>And purge th&#8217; ob&#383;tru&#392;tions, which begin to &#383;top</line>
<line>Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.</line>
<line>I haue in equall ballance iu&#383;tly weigh&#8217;d,</line>

<line>That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,</line>

<line>Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,</line>
<line>Either from the King, or in the pre&#383;ent Time,</line>
<line>That you &#383;hould haue an ynch of any ground</line>

<line>To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,</line>
<line>Your Noble, and right well-remembred Fathers?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>What thing, in Honor, had my Father lo&#383;t,</line>
<line>That need to be reuiu&#8217;d, and breath&#8217;d in me?</line>
<line>The King that lou&#8217;d him, as the State &#383;tood then,</line>
<line>Was forc&#8217;d, perforce compell&#8217;d to bani&#383;h him:</line>
<line>And then, that <nameref>Henry Bullingbrooke</nameref> and hee</line>
<line>Being mounted, and both row&#383;ed in their Seates,</line>

<line>And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:</line>
<line>Then, then, when there was nothing could haue &#383;tay&#8217;d</line>
<line>My Father from the Brea&#383;t of <nameref>Bullingbrooke</nameref>;</line>
<line>O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,</line>
<line>(His owne Life hung vpon the Sta&#64256;e hee threw)</line>
<line>Then threw hee downe him&#383;elfe, and all their Liues,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>We&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;peak (Lord <nameref>Mowbray</nameref>) now you know not what.</line>

<line>In England the mo&#383;t valiant Gentleman.</line>
<line>Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue &#383;mil&#8217;d?</line>
<line>But if your Father had beene Vi&#392;tor there,</line>
<line>Hee ne&#8217;re had borne it out of Couentry.</line>
<line>For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,</line>
<line>Cry&#8217;d hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,</line>
<line>Were &#383;et on <nameref>Herford</nameref>, whom they doted on,</line>
<line>And ble&#383;s&#8217;d, and grac&#8217;d, and did more then the King.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>We&#383;t.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Mowbray</nameref>, you ouer-weene to take it &#383;o:</line>

<line>For loe, within a Ken our Army lyes,</line>
<line>Vpon mine Honor, all too con&#64257;dent</line>

<line>All members of our Cau&#383;e, both here, and hence,</line>
<line>That are in&#383;inewed to this A&#392;tion,</line>

<line>And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>We&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>This will I &#383;hew the Generall. Plea&#383;e you Lords,</line>
<line>In &#383;ight of both our Battailes, wee may meete</line>
<line>At either end in peace: which Heauen &#383;o frame,</line>
<line>Or to the place of di&#64256;erence call the Swords,</line>
<line>Which mu&#383;t decide it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bi&#383;h.</speaker>
<line>My Lord, wee will doe &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>There is a thing within my Bo&#383;ome tells me,</line>
<line>That no Conditions of our Peace can &#383;tand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#64262;.</speaker>
<line>Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace</line>
<line>Vpon &#383;uch large termes, and &#383;o ab&#383;olute,</line>
<line>As our Conditions &#383;hall con&#383;i&#383;t vpon,</line>
<line>Our Peace &#383;hall &#383;tand as &#64257;rme as Rockie Mountaines.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>I, but our valuation &#383;hall be &#383;uch,</line>
<line>That euery &#383;light, and fal&#383;e-deriued Cau&#383;e,</line>
<line>Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Rea&#383;on,</line>
<line>Shall, to the King, ta&#383;te of this A&#392;tion:</line>
<line>That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,</line>
<line>Wee &#383;hall be winnowed with &#383;o rough a winde,</line>
<line>That euen our Corne &#383;hall &#383;eeme as light as Cha&#64256;e,</line>
<line>And good from bad &#64257;nde no partition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bi&#383;h.</speaker>
<line>No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie</line>
<line>Of daintie, and &#383;uch picking Grieuances:</line>
<line>For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,</line>
<line>Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.</line>
<line>And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,</line>
<line>And keepe no Tell-tale to his Memorie,</line>
<line>That may repeat, and Hi&#383;torie his lo&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>To new remembrance. For full well hee knowes,</line>
<line>Hee cannot &#383;o preci&#383;ely weede this Land,</line>
<line>As his mi&#383;-doubts pre&#383;ent occa&#383;ion:</line>
<line>His foes are &#383;o en-rooted with his friends,</line>
<line>That plucking to vn&#64257;xe an Enemie,</line>
<line>Hee doth vnfa&#383;ten &#383;o, and &#383;hake a friend.</line>
<line>So that this Land, like an o&#64256;en&#383;iue wife,</line>
<line>That hath enrag&#8217;d him on, to o&#64256;er &#383;trokes,</line>
<line>As he is &#383;triking, holds his Infant vp,</line>
<line>And hangs re&#383;olu&#8217;d Corre&#392;tion in the Arme,</line>
<line>That was vprear&#8217;d to execution.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Be&#383;ides, the King hath wa&#383;ted all his Rods,</line>
<line>On late O&#64256;enders, that he now doth lacke</line>
<line>The very In&#383;truments of Cha&#383;ticement:</line>
<line>So that his power, like to a Fangle&#383;&#383;e Lion</line>
<line>May o&#64256;er, but not hold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bi&#383;h.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis very true:</line>
<line>And therefore be a&#383;&#383;ur&#8217;d (my good Lord Mar&#383;hal)</line>
<line>If we do now make our attonement well,</line>
<line>Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)</line>

<line>I would you had but the wit: &#8217;twere better</line>
<line>then your Dukedome. Good faith, this &#383;ame young &#383;o-</line>
<line>ber-blooded Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot</line>
<line>make him laugh: but that&#8217;s no maruaile, hee drinkes no</line>
<line>Wine. There&#8217;s neuer any of the&#383;e demure Boyes come</line>
<line>to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth &#383;o ouer-coole</line>
<line>their blood, and making many Fi&#383;h-Meales, that they</line>
<line>fall into a kinde of Male Greene-&#383;ickne&#383;&#383;e: and then,</line>
<line>when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally</line>
<line>Fooles, and Cowards; which &#383;ome of vs &#383;hould be too,</line>
<line>but for in&#64258;amation. A good Sherris-Sack hath a two-</line>
<line>fold operation in it: it a&#383;cends me into the Braine, dryes</line>
<line>me there all the fooli&#383;h, and dull, and cruddie Vapours,</line>
<line>which enuiron it: makes it apprehen&#383;iue, quicke, forge-</line>
<line>tiue, full of nimble, &#64257;erie, and dele&#392;table &#383;hapes; which</line>
<line>deliuer&#8217;d o&#8217;re to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the</line>
<line>Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The &#383;econd propertie of</line>
<line>your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood:</line>
<line>which before (cold, and &#383;etled) left the Liuer white, and</line>
<line>pale; which is the Badge of Pu&#383;illanimitie, and Cowar-</line>
<line>dize: but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it cour&#383;e</line>
<line>from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth</line>
<line>the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the</line>
<line>re&#383;t of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then</line>
<line>the Vitall Commoners, and in-land pettie Spirits, mu&#383;ter</line>
<line>me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pu&#64256;t</line>
<line>vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this</line>
<line>Valour comes of Sherris. So, that skill in the Weapon</line>
<line>is nothing, without Sack (for that &#383;ets it a-worke:) and</line>
<line>Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till</line>
<line>Sack commences it, and &#383;ets it in a&#392;t, and v&#383;e. Hereof</line>
<line>comes it, that Prince <nameref>Harry</nameref> is valiant: for the cold blood</line>
<line>hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like</line>
<line>leane, &#383;tirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and</line>
<line>tyll&#8217;d, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and</line>
<line>good &#383;tore of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot,</line>
<line>and valiant. If I had a thou&#383;and Sonnes, the &#64257;r&#383;t Principle</line>
<line>I would teach them, &#383;hould be to for&#383;weare thinne Pota-</line>

<line>Hermites &#383;taues, as Ma&#383;ter <nameref>Shallow</nameref>. It is a wonderfull</line>
<line>thing to &#383;ee the &#383;emblable Coherence of his mens &#383;pirits,</line>
<line>and his: They, by ob&#383;eruing of him, do beare them&#383;elues</line>

<line>ciety, that they &#64258;ocke together in con&#383;ent, like &#383;o ma-</line>
<line>ny Wilde-Gee&#383;e. If I had a &#383;uite to May&#383;ter <nameref>Shallow</nameref>, I</line>
<line>would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing</line>
<line>neere their May&#383;ter. If to his Men, I would currie with</line>
<line>Mai&#383;ter <nameref>Shallow</nameref>, that no man could better command his</line>
<line>Seruants. It is certaine, that either wi&#383;e bearing, or ig-</line>
<line>norant Carriage is caught, as men take di&#383;ea&#383;es, one of</line>
<line>another: therefore, let men take heede of their Compa-</line>
<line>nie. I will deui&#383;e matter enough out of this <nameref>Shallow</nameref>, to</line>
<line>keepe Prince <nameref>Harry</nameref> in continuall Laughter, the wearing</line>
<line>out of &#383;ixe Fa&#383;hions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Ac-</line>
<line>tions, and he &#383;hall laugh with <italic>Interuallums</italic>. O it is much</line>
<line>that a Lye (with a &#383;light Oath) and a ie&#383;t (with a &#383;adde</line>
<line>brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache</line>
