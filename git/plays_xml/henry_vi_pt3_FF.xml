<line>Short Tale to make, we at S. Albons met,</line>
<line>Our Battailes ioyn&#8217;d, and both &#383;ides &#64257;ercely fought:</line>
<line>But whether &#8217;twas the coldne&#383;&#383;e of the King,</line>
<line>Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike Queene,</line>
<line>That robb&#8217;d my Soldiers of their heated Spleene.</line>
<line>Or whether &#8217;twas report of her &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Or more then common feare of <nameref>Cliffords</nameref> Rigour,</line>
<line>Who thunders to his Captiues, Blood and Death,</line>
<line>I cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,</line>
<line>Their Weapons like to Lightning, came and went:</line>
<line>Our Souldiers like the Night-Owles lazie &#64258;ight,</line>
<line>Or like a lazie Thre&#383;her with a Flaile,</line>
<line>Fell gently downe, as if they &#383;trucke their Friends.</line>
<line>I cheer&#8217;d them vp with iu&#383;tice of our Cau&#383;e,</line>
<line>With promi&#383;e of high pay, and great Rewards:</line>
<line>But all in vaine, they had no heart to &#64257;ght,</line>
<line>And we (in them) no hope to win the day,</line>
<line>So that we &#64258;ed: the King vnto the Queene,</line>
<line>Lord <nameref>George</nameref>, your Brother, Norfolke, and my Selfe,</line>
<line>In ha&#383;te, po&#383;t ha&#383;te, are come to ioyne with you:</line>
<line>For in the Marches heere we heard you were,</line>
<line>Making another Head, to &#64257;ght againe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ed.</speaker>
<line>Where is the Duke of Norfolke, gentle Warwick?</line>
<line>And when came <nameref>George</nameref> from Burgundy to England?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Some &#383;ix miles off the Duke is with the Soldiers,</line>
<line>And for your Brother he was lately &#383;ent</line>
<line>From your kinde Aunt Dutche&#383;&#383;e of Burgundie,</line>
<line>With ayde of Souldiers to this needfull Warre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twas oddes belike, when valiant Warwick &#64258;ed;</line>
<line>O&#64261; haue I heard his prai&#383;es in Pur&#383;uite,</line>
<line>But ne&#8217;re till now, his Scandall of Retire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Nor now my Scandall <nameref>Richard</nameref>, do&#383;t thou heare:</line>
<line>For thou &#383;halt know this &#383;trong right hand of mine,</line>
<line>Can plucke the Diadem from faint <nameref>Henries</nameref> head,</line>
<line>And wring the awefull Scepter from his Fi&#383;t,</line>
<line>Were he as famous, and as bold in Warre,</line>
<line>As he is fam&#8217;d for Mildne&#383;&#383;e, Peace, and Prayer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>I know it well Lord Warwick, blame me not,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis loue I beare thy glories make me &#383;peake:</line>
<line>But in this troublous time, what&#8217;s to be done?</line>
<line>Shall we go throw away our Coates of Steele,</line>
<line>And wrap our bodies in blacke mourning Gownes,</line>
<line>Numb&#8217;ring our Aue-Maries with our Beads?</line>
<line>Or &#383;hall we on the Helmets of our F&#339;s</line>
<line>Tell our Deuotion with reuengefull Armes?</line>
<line>If for the la&#383;t, &#383;ay I, and to it Lords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Why therefore Warwick came to &#383;eek you out,</line>
<line>And therefore comes my Brother <nameref>Mountague</nameref>:</line>
<line>Attend me Lords, the proud in&#383;ulting Queene,</line>
<line>With <nameref>Clifford</nameref>, and the haught Northumberland,</line>
<line>And of their Feather, many m&#339; proud Birds,</line>
<line>Haue wrought the ea&#383;ie-melting King, like Wax.</line>
<line>He &#383;wore con&#383;ent to your Succe&#383;&#383;ion,</line>
<line>His Oath enrolled in the Parliament.</line>
<line>And now to London all the crew are gone,</line>
<line>To fru&#383;trate both his Oath, and what be&#383;ide</line>
<line>May make again&#383;t the hou&#383;e of Lanca&#383;ter.</line>
<line>Their power (I thinke) is thirty thou&#383;and &#383;trong:</line>
<line>Now, if the helpe of Norfolke, and my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>With all the Friends that thou braue Earle of March,</line>
<line>Among&#8217;&#383;t the louing Wel&#383;hmen can&#8217;&#383;t procure,</line>
<line>Will but amount to &#64257;ue and twenty thou&#383;and,</line>
<line>Why Via, to London will we march,</line>
<line>And once againe, be&#383;tride our foaming Steeds,</line>
<line>And once againe cry Charge vpon our F&#339;s,</line>
<line>But neuer once againe turne backe and &#64258;ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>I, now me thinks I heare great Warwick &#383;peak;</line>
<line>Ne&#8217;re may he liue to &#383;ee a Sun-&#383;hine day,</line>
<line>That cries Retire, if Warwicke bid him &#383;tay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ed.</speaker>
<line>Lord Warwicke, on thy &#383;houlder will I leane,</line>
<line>And when thou fail&#383;t (as God forbid the houre)</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>No longer Earle of March, but Duke of Yorke:</line>
<line>The next degree, is Englands Royall Throne:</line>
<line>For King of England &#383;halt thou be proclaim&#8217;d</line>
<line>In euery Burrough as we pa&#383;&#383;e along,</line>
<line>And he that throwes not vp his cap for ioy,</line>

<line>Stay we no longer, dreaming of Renowne.</line>
<line>But &#383;ound the Trumpets, and about our Taske.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>

<line>The lu&#383;tfull <nameref>Edwards</nameref> Title buryed,</line>
<line>Is <nameref>Clarence, Henry,</nameref> and his Sonne young <nameref>Edward</nameref>,</line>
<line>And all the vnlook&#8217;d-for I&#383;&#383;ue of their Bodies,</line>
<line>To take their Roomes, ere I can place my &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>A cold premeditation for my purpo&#383;e.</line>
<line>Why then I d&#339; but dreame on Soueraigntie,</line>
<line>Like one that &#383;tands vpon a Promontorie,</line>
<line>And &#383;pyes a farre-off &#383;hore, where hee would tread,</line>
<line>Wi&#383;hing his foot were equall with his eye,</line>
<line>And chides the Sea, that &#383;unders him from thence,</line>
<line>Saying hee&#8217;le lade it dry, to haue his way:</line>
<line>So d&#339; I wi&#383;h the Crowne, being &#383;o farre off,</line>
<line>And &#383;o I chide the meanes that keepes me from it,</line>
<line>And &#383;o (I &#383;ay) Ile cut the Cau&#383;es off,</line>
<line>Flattering me with impo&#383;&#383;ibilities:</line>
<line>My Eyes too quicke, my Heart o&#8217;re-weenes too much,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e my Hand and Strength could equall them.</line>
<line>Well, &#383;ay there is no Kingdome then for <nameref>Richard</nameref>:</line>
<line>What other Plea&#383;ure can the World affoord?</line>
<line>Ile make my Heauen in a Ladies Lappe,</line>
<line>And decke my Body in gay Ornaments,</line>
<line>And &#8217;witch &#383;weet Ladies with my Words and Lookes.</line>
<line>Oh mi&#383;erable Thought! and more vnlikely,</line>
<line>Then to accompli&#383;h twentie Golden Crownes.</line>
<line>Why Loue for&#383;wore me in my Mothers Wombe:</line>
<line>And for I &#383;hould not deale in her &#383;o&#64261; Lawes,</line>
<line>Shee did corrupt frayle Nature with &#383;ome Bribe,</line>
<line>To &#383;hrinke mine Arme vp like a wither&#8217;d Shrub,</line>
<line>To make an enuious Mountaine on my Back,</line>
<line>Where &#383;its Deformitie to mocke my Body;</line>
<line>To &#383;hape my Legges of an vnequall &#383;ize,</line>
<line>To di&#383;-proportion me in euery part:</line>
<line>Like to a Chaos, or an vn-lick&#8217;d Beare-whelpe,</line>
<line>That carryes no impre&#383;&#383;ion like the Damme.</line>
<line>And am I then a man to be belou&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Oh mon&#383;trous fault, to harbour &#383;uch a thought.</line>
<line>Then &#383;ince this Earth affoords no Ioy to me,</line>
<line>But to command, to check, to o&#8217;re-beare &#383;uch,</line>
<line>As are of better Per&#383;on then my &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>Ile make my Heauen, to dreame vpon the Crowne,</line>
<line>And whiles I liue, t&#8217;account this World but Hell,</line>
<line>Vntill my mis-&#383;hap&#8217;d Trunke, that beares this Head,</line>
<line>Be round impaled with a glorious Crowne.</line>
<line>And yet I know not how to get the Crowne,</line>
<line>For many Liues &#383;tand betweene me and home:</line>
<line>And I, like one lo&#383;t in a Thornie Wood,</line>
<line>That rents the Thornes, and is rent with the Thornes,</line>
<line>Seeking a way, and &#383;traying from the way,</line>
<line>Not knowing how to &#64257;nde the open Ayre,</line>
<line>But toyling de&#383;perately to &#64257;nde it out,</line>
<line>Torment my &#383;elfe, to catch the Engli&#383;h Crowne:</line>
<line>And from that torment I will free my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Or hew my way out with a bloody Axe.</line>
<line>Why I can &#383;mile, and murther whiles I &#383;mile,</line>
<line>And cry, Content, to that which grieues my Heart,</line>
<line>And wet my Cheekes with arti&#64257;ciall Teares,</line>
<line>And frame my Face to all occa&#383;ions.</line>
<line>Ile drowne more Saylers then the Mermaid &#383;hall,</line>
<line>Ile &#383;lay more gazers then the Ba&#383;iliske,</line>
<line>Ile play the Orator as well as <nameref>Ne&#383;tor</nameref>,</line>
<line>Deceiue more &#383;lyly then <nameref>Vli&#383;&#383;es</nameref> could,</line>
<line>And like a <nameref>Synon</nameref>, take another Troy.</line>
<line>I can adde Colours to the Camelion,</line>
<line>Change &#383;hapes with <nameref>Proteus</nameref>, for aduantages,</line>
<line>And &#383;et the murtherous <nameref>Macheuill</nameref> to Schoole.</line>
<line>Can I d&#339; this, and cannot get a Crowne?</line>
<line>Tut, were it farther off, Ile plucke it downe.<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir></line>

<line>Which are &#383;o weake of courage, and in iudgement,</line>
<line>That they&#8217;le take no offence at our abu&#383;e.</line>

<line>Speake freely what you thinke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>Then this is mine opinion:</line>
<line>That King <nameref>Lewis</nameref> becomes your Enemie,</line>
<line>For mocking him about the Marriage</line>
<line>Of the Lady <nameref>Bona</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And <nameref>Warwicke</nameref>, doing what you gaue in charge,</line>
<line>Is now dis-honored by this new Marriage.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Mount.</speaker>

<line>Would more haue &#383;trength&#8217;ned this our Commonwealth</line>
<line>&#8217;Gain&#383;t forraine &#383;tormes, then any home-bred Marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Why, knowes not <nameref>Mountague</nameref>, that of it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>England is &#383;afe, if true within it &#383;elfe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mount.</speaker>
<line>But the &#383;afer, when &#8217;tis back&#8217;d with France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis better v&#383;ing France, then tru&#383;ting France:</line>
