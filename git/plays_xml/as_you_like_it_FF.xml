</speech>

<speech>

<line>Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<line>Marry doe I &#383;ir: and I came to acquaint you</line>
<line>with a matter: I am giuen &#383;ir &#383;ecretly to vnder&#383;tand, that</line>
<line>your yonger brother <nameref>Orlando</nameref> hath a di&#383;po&#383;ition to come</line>
<line>in di&#383;guis&#8217;d again&#383;t mee to try a fall: to morrow &#383;ir I</line>
<line>wra&#383;tle for my credit, and hee that e&#383;capes me without</line>
<line>&#383;ome broken limbe, &#383;hall acquit him well: your brother</line>
<line>is but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee</line>
<line>loth to &#383;oyle him, as I mu&#383;t for my owne honour if hee</line>
<line>come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither</line>
<line>to acquaint you withall, that either you might &#383;tay him</line>
<line>from his intendment, or brooke &#383;uch di&#383;grace well as he</line>
<line>&#383;hall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne &#383;earch,</line>
<line>and altogether again&#383;t my will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Oli.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Charles</nameref> , I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which</line>
<line>thou &#383;halt finde I will mo&#383;t kindly requite: I had my</line>
<line>&#383;elfe notice of my Brothers purpo&#383;e heerein, and haue by</line>
<line>vnder-hand meanes laboured to di&#383;&#383;wade him from it;</line>
<line>but he is re&#383;olute. Ile tell thee <nameref>Charles</nameref>, it is the &#383;tubbor-</line>
<line>ne&#383;t yong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious</line>
<line>emulator of euery mans good parts, a &#383;ecret &amp; villanous</line>
<line>contriuer again&#383;t mee his naturall brother: therefore v&#383;e</line>
<line>thy di&#383;cretion, I had as lie&#383;e thou did&#383;t breake his necke</line>
<line>as his finger. And thou wert be&#383;t looke to&#8217;t; for if thou</line>
<line>do&#383;t him any &#383;light di&#383;grace, or if hee doe not mightilie</line>
<line>grace him&#383;elfe on thee, hee will pra&#392;ti&#383;e again&#383;t thee by</line>
<line>poy&#383;on, entrap thee by &#383;ome treacherous deui&#383;e, and ne-</line>
<line>uer leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by &#383;ome indire&#392;t</line>
<line>meanes or other: for I a&#383;&#383;ure thee, (and almo&#383;t with</line>
<line>teares I &#383;peake it) there is not one &#383;o young, and &#383;o vil-</line>
<line>lanous this day liuing. I &#383;peake but brotherly of him,</line>
<line>but &#383;hould I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I mu&#383;t</line>
<line>blu&#383;h, and weepe, and thou mu&#383;t looke pale and</line>
<line>wonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cha.</speaker>
<line>I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee</line>
<line>come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee</line>
<line>goe alone againe, Ile neuer wra&#383;tle for prize more: and</line>
<line>&#383;o God keepe your wor&#383;hip. <stagedir>Exit.</stagedir></line>
<line>Farewell good <nameref>Charles</nameref>. Now will I &#383;tirre this Game-</line>
<line>&#383;ter: I hope I &#383;hall &#383;ee an end of him; for my &#383;oule (yet</line>
<line>I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee&#8217;s</line>
<line>gentle, neuer &#383;chool&#8217;d, and yet learned, full of noble</line>
<line>deui&#383;e, of all &#383;orts enchantingly beloued, and indeed</line>
<line>&#383;o much in the heart of the world, and e&#383;pecially of my</line>
<line>owne people, who be&#383;t know him, that I am altogether</line>
<line>mi&#383;pri&#383;ed: but it &#383;hall not be &#383;o long, this wra&#383;tler &#383;hall</line>
<line>cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy</line>
<line>thither, which now Ile goe about. </line>

<line>As I do liue by foode, I met a foole,</line>
<line>Who laid him downe, and bask&#8217;d him in the Sun,</line>
<line>And rail&#8217;d on Lady Fortune in good termes,</line>
<line>In good &#383;et termes, and yet a motley foole.</line>
<line>Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he,</line>
<line>Call me not foole, till heauen hath &#383;ent me fortune,</line>

<line>Sayes, very wi&#383;ely, it is ten a clocke:</line>
<line>Thus we may &#383;ee (quoth he) how the world wagges:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Clow.</speaker>
<line>Truely Shepheard, in re&#383;pe&#392;t of it &#383;elfe, it is a</line>
<line>good life; but in re&#383;pe&#392;t that it is a &#383;hepheards life, it is</line>
<line>naught. In re&#383;pe&#392;t that it is &#383;olitary, I like it verie well:</line>
<line>but in re&#383;pe&#392;t that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now</line>
<line>in re&#383;pe&#392;t it is in the fields, it plea&#383;eth mee well: but in</line>
<line>re&#383;pe&#392;t it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a &#383;pare</line>
<line>life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no</line>
<line>more plentie in it, it goes much again&#383;t my &#383;tomacke.</line>
<line>Has&#8217;t any Philo&#383;ophie in thee &#383;hepheard?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Cor.</speaker>
<line>No more, but that I know the more one &#383;ickens,</line>
<line>the wor&#383;e at ea&#383;e he is: and that hee that wants money,</line>
<line>meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That</line>
<line>the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That</line>
<line>pood pa&#383;ture makes fat &#383;heepe: and that a great cau&#383;e of</line>
<line>the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath lear-</line>
<line>ned no wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good</line>
<line>breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clo.</speaker>
<line>Such a one is a naturall Philo&#383;opher:</line>

<line>cau&#383;e he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of</line>

<line>I haue bin told &#383;o of many: but indeed, an olde</line>
<line>religious Vnckle of mine taught me to &#383;peake, who was</line>

<line>No: I wil not ca&#383;t away my phy&#383;ick, but on tho&#383;e</line>

<line>barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on</line>
<line>brambles; all (for&#383;ooth) defying the name of <nameref>Ro&#383;alinde</nameref>.</line>
<line>If I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke &#383;ilke haire,</line>
<line>Your bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame</line>
<line>That can entame my &#383;pirits to your wor&#383;hip:</line>

<line>And out of you &#383;he &#383;ees her &#383;elfe more proper</line>
<line>Then any of her lineaments can &#383;how her:</line>
<line>But Mi&#383;tris, know your &#383;elfe, downe on your knees</line>
<line>And thanke heauen, fa&#383;ting, for a good mans loue;</line>
<line>For I mu&#383;t tell you friendly in your eare,</line>

<line>Cry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer,</line>
<line>Foule is mo&#383;t foule, being foule to be a &#383;coffer.</line>
<line>So take her to thee Shepheard, fare you well.</line>

<line>Why that were couetou&#383;ne&#383;&#383;e:</line>
<line><nameref>Siluius</nameref>; the time was, that I hated thee;</line>
<line>And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue,</line>
<line>But &#383;ince that thou can&#383;t talke of loue &#383;o well,</line>
<line>Thy company, which er&#383;t was irke&#383;ome to me</line>
<line>I will endure; and Ile employ thee too:</line>
<line>But doe not looke for further recompence</line>
<line>Then thine owne gladne&#383;&#383;e, that thou art employd.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<line>So holy, and &#383;o perfe&#392;t is my loue,</line>
<line>And I in &#383;uch a pouerty of grace,</line>
<line>That I &#383;hall thinke it a mo&#383;t plenteous crop</line>
<line>To gleane the broken eares after the man</line>
<line>That the maine harue&#383;t reapes: loo&#383;e now and then</line>
<line>A &#383;cattred &#383;mile, and that Ile liue vpon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phe.</speaker>
<line>Know&#383;t thou the youth that &#383;poke to mee yerewhile?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<line>Not very well, but I haue met him oft,</line>
<line>And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds</line>
<line>That the old <nameref>Carlot</nameref> once was Ma&#383;ter of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phe.</speaker>
<line>Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but a peeui&#383;h boy, yet he talkes well,</line>
<line>But what care I for words? yet words do well</line>
<line>When he that &#383;peakes them plea&#383;es tho&#383;e that heare:</line>
<line>It is a pretty youth, not very prettie,</line>
<line>But &#383;ure hee&#8217;s proud, and yet his pride becomes him;</line>
<line>Hee&#8217;ll make a proper man: the be&#383;t thing in him</line>
<line>Is his complexion: and fa&#383;ter then his tongue</line>
<line>Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp:</line>
<line>He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee&#8217;s tall:</line>
<line>His leg is but &#383;o &#383;o, and yet &#8217;tis well:</line>
<line>There was a pretty redne&#383;&#383;e in his lip,</line>
<line>A little riper, and more lu&#383;tie red</line>
<line>Then that mixt in his cheeke: &#8217;twas iu&#383;t the difference</line>
<line>Betwixt the con&#383;tant red, and mingled Damaske.</line>
<line>There be &#383;ome women <nameref>Siluius</nameref>, had they markt him</line>
<line>In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere</line>
<line>To fall in loue with him: but for my part</line>
<line>I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet</line>
<line>Haue more cau&#383;e to hate him then to loue him,</line>
<line>For what had he to doe to chide at me?</line>
<line>He &#383;aid mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,</line>
<line>And now I am remembred, &#383;corn&#8217;d at me:</line>
<line>I maruell why I an&#383;wer&#8217;d not againe,</line>
<line>But that&#8217;s all one: omittance is no quittance:</line>
<line>Ile write to him a very tanting Letter,</line>
<line>And thou &#383;halt beare it, wilt thou <nameref>Siluius</nameref>?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Sil.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Phebe</nameref>, with all my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phe.</speaker>
<line>Ile write it &#383;trait:</line>
<line>The matter&#8217;s in my head, and in my heart,</line>
<line>I will be bitter with him, and pa&#383;&#383;ing &#383;hort;</line>

<line>Tho&#383;e that are in extremity of either, are abho-</line>

<line>which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick:</line>
<line>nor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which</line>

<line>pounded of many &#383;imples, extra&#392;ted from many obie&#392;ts,</line>
<line>and indeed the &#383;undrie contemplation of my trauells, in</line>

<line>was not anie man died in his owne per&#383;on (<italic>videlicet</italic>) in</line>
<line>a loue cau&#383;e: <nameref>Troilous</nameref> had his braines da&#383;h&#8217;d out with a</line>
<line>Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before,</line>
<line>and he is one of the patternes of loue. <nameref>Leander</nameref>, he would</line>
<line>haue liu&#8217;d manie a faire yeere though <nameref>Hero</nameref> had turn&#8217;d</line>
<line>Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Mid&#383;omer-night, for</line>
<line>(good youth) he went but forth to wa&#383;h him in the Hel-</line>
<line>le&#383;pont, and being taken with the crampe, was droun&#8217;d,</line>
<line>and the fooli&#383;h Chronoclers of that age, found it was</line>
<line><nameref>Hero</nameref> of Ce&#383;tos. But the&#383;e are all lies, men haue died</line>
<line>from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not</line>
<line>for loue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Orl.</speaker>
<line>I would not haue my right <nameref>Ro&#383;alind</nameref> of this mind,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ro&#383;.</speaker>
<line>By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come,</line>
<line>now I will be your <nameref>Ro&#383;alind</nameref> in a more comming-on di&#383;-</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Orl.</speaker>

<line>thought runs before her a&#392;tions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>ges when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of</line>
<line>thee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more</line>
<line>clamorous then a Parrat again&#383;t raine, more new-fang-</line>

<line>uenth, the Lye dire&#392;t: all the&#383;e you may auoyd, but the</line>
<line>Lye dire&#392;t: and you may auoide that too, with an If. I</line>
<line>knew when &#383;euen Iu&#383;tices could not take vp a Quarrell,</line>
<line>but when the parties were met them&#383;elues, one of them</line>
<line>thought but of an If; as if you &#383;aide &#383;o, then I &#383;aide &#383;o:</line>
