<line order="first"><dropcap type="floral">N</dropcap>ow is the Winter of our Di&#383;content,</line>
<line order="second">Made glorious Summer by this Son of Yorke:</line>
<line order="third">And all the clouds that lowr&#8217;d vpon our hou&#383;e</line>
<line>In the deepe bo&#383;ome of the Ocean buried.</line>
<line>Now are our browes bound with Vi&#392;torious Wreathes,</line>
<line>Our brui&#383;ed armes hung vp for Monuments;</line>
<line>Our &#383;terne Alarums chang&#8217;d to merry Meetings;</line>
<line>Our dreadfull Marches, to delightfull Mea&#383;ures.</line>
<line>Grim-vi&#383;ag&#8217;d Warre, hath &#383;mooth&#8217;d his wrinkled Front:</line>
<line>And now, in &#383;tead of mounting Barbed Steeds,</line>
<line>To fright the Soules of fearfull Aduer&#383;aries,</line>
<line>He capers nimbly in a Ladies Chamber,</line>
<line>To the la&#383;ciuious plea&#383;ing of a Lute.</line>
<line>But I, that am not &#383;hap&#8217;d for &#383;portiue trickes,</line>
<line>Nor made to court an amorous Looking-gla&#383;&#383;e:</line>
<line>I, that am Rudely &#383;tampt, and want loues Maie&#383;ty,</line>
<line>To &#383;trut before a wonton ambling Nymph:</line>
<line>I, that am curtail&#8217;d of this faire Proportion,</line>
<line>Cheated of Feature by di&#383;&#383;embling Nature,</line>
<line>Deform&#8217;d, vn-&#64257;ni&#383;h&#8217;d, &#383;ent before my time</line>
<line>Into this breathing World, &#383;car&#383;e halfe made vp,</line>
<line>And that &#383;o lamely and vnfa&#383;hionable,</line>
<line>That dogges barke at me, as I halt by them.</line>
<line>Why I (in this weake piping time of Peace)</line>
<line>Haue no delight to pa&#383;&#383;e away the time,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e to &#383;ee my Shadow in the Sunne,</line>
<line>And de&#383;cant on mine owne Deformity.</line>
<line>And therefore, &#383;ince I cannot proue a Louer,</line>
<line>To entertaine the&#383;e faire well &#383;poken dayes,</line>
<line>I am determined to proue a Villaine,</line>
<line>And hate the idle plea&#383;ures of the&#383;e dayes.</line>
<line>Plots haue I laide, Indu&#392;tions dangerous,</line>
<line>By drunken Prophe&#64257;es, Libels, and Dreames,</line>
<line>To &#383;et my Brother <nameref>Clarence</nameref> and the King</line>
<line>In deadly hate, the one again&#64261; the other:</line>
<line>And if King <nameref>Edward</nameref> be as true and iu&#64261;,</line>
<line>As I am Subtle, Fal&#383;e, and Treacherous,</line>
<line>This day &#383;hould <nameref>Clarence</nameref> clo&#383;ely be mew&#8217;d vp:</line>
<line>About a Prophe&#383;ie, which &#383;ayes that G,</line>
<line>Of <nameref>Edwards</nameref> heyres the murtherer &#383;hall be.</line>
<line>Diue thoughts downe to my &#383;oule, here <nameref>Clarence</nameref> comes.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Clarence, and Brakenbury, guarded.</stagedir>

<line>Brother, good day: What meanes this armed guard</line>
<line>That waites vpon your Grace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<line>His Maie&#383;ty tendring my per&#383;ons &#383;afety,</line>
<line>Hath appointed this Condu&#392;t, to conuey me to th&#8217; Tower</line>
</speech>

<line>O belike, his Maie&#64261;y hath &#383;ome intent,</line>
<line>That you &#383;hould be new Chri&#383;tned in the Tower,</line>
<line>But what&#8217;s the matter <nameref>Clarence</nameref>, may I know?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<line>Yea <nameref>Richard</nameref>, when I know: but I prote&#64261;</line>
<line>As yet I do not: But as I can learne,</line>
<line>He hearkens a&#64261;er Prophe&#383;ies and Dreames,</line>
<line>And from the Cro&#383;&#383;e-row pluckes the letter G:</line>
<line>And &#383;ayes, a Wizard told him, that by G,</line>
<line>His i&#383;&#383;ue di&#383;inherited &#383;hould be.</line>
<line>And for my name of <nameref>George</nameref> begins with G,</line>
<line>It followes in his thought, that I am he.</line>
<line>The&#383;e (as I learne) and &#383;uch like toyes as the&#383;e,</line>
<line>Hath moou&#8217;d his Highne&#383;&#383;e to commit me now.</line>

<line>My Lady <nameref>Grey</nameref> his Wife, <nameref>Clarence</nameref> &#8217;tis &#383;hee,</line>
<line>That tempts him to this har&#383;h Extremity.</line>

<line><nameref>Anthony Woodeuile</nameref> her Brother there,</line>
<line>That made him &#383;end Lord <nameref>Ha&#383;tings</nameref> to the Tower?</line>

<line>Well are you welcome to this open Ayre,</line>
<line>How hath your Lord&#383;hip brook&#8217;d impri&#383;onment?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>With patience (Noble Lord) as pri&#383;oners mu&#383;t:</line>
<line>But I &#383;hall liue (my Lord) to giue them thankes</line>
<line>That were the cau&#383;e of my impri&#383;onment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>No doubt, no doubt, and &#383;o &#383;hall <nameref>Clarence</nameref> too,</line>

<line>And haue preuail&#8217;d as much on him, as you,</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>

<line>What newes abroad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>No newes &#383;o bad abroad, as this at home:</line>
<line>The King is &#383;ickly, weake, and melancholly,</line>
<line>And his Phy&#383;itians feare him mightily.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Now by S. Iohn, that Newes is bad indeed.</line>
<line>O he hath kept an euill Diet long,</line>
<line>And ouer-much con&#383;um&#8217;d his Royall Per&#383;on:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis very greeuous to be thought vpon.</line>
<line>Where is he, in his bed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ha&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>He is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Go you before, and I will follow you.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Ha&#383;tings.</stagedir>
<line>He cannot liue I hope, and mu&#383;t not dye,</line>
<line>Till George be pack&#8217;d with po&#383;t-hor&#383;e vp to Heauen.</line>
<line>Ile in to vrge his hatred more to <nameref>Clarence</nameref>,</line>
<line>With Lyes well &#383;teel&#8217;d with weighty Arguments,</line>
<line>And if I faile not in my deepe intent,</line>
<line><nameref>Clarence</nameref> hath not another day to liue:</line>
<line>Which done, God take King <nameref>Edward</nameref> to his mercy,</line>
<line>And leaue the world for me to bu&#383;sle in.</line>
<line>For then, Ile marry Warwickes yonge&#383;t daughter.</line>
<line>What though I kill&#8217;d her Husband, and her Father,</line>
<line>The readie&#383;t way to make the Wench amends,</line>
<line>Is to become her Husband, and her Father:</line>
<line>The which will I, not all &#383;o much for loue,</line>
<line>As for another &#383;ecret clo&#383;e intent,</line>
<line>By marrying her, which I mu&#383;t reach vnto.</line>
<line>But yet I run before my hor&#383;e to Market:</line>
<line>Clarence &#383;till breathes, <nameref>Edward</nameref> &#64261;ill liues and raignes,</line>
<line>When they are gone, then mu&#383;t I count my gaines.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>Ile not meddle with it, it makes a man a Coward:</line>
<line>A man cannot &#383;teale, but it accu&#383;eth him: A man cannot</line>
<line>Sweare, but it Checkes him: A man cannot lye with his</line>
<line>Neighbours Wife, but it dete&#392;ts him. &#8217;Tis a blu&#383;hing</line>
<line>&#383;hamefac&#8217;d &#383;pirit, that mutinies in a mans bo&#383;ome: It</line>
<line>&#64257;lles a man full of Ob&#383;tacles. It made me once re&#383;tore a</line>
<line>Pur&#383;&#383;e of Gold that (by chance) I found: It beggars any</line>
<line>man that keepes it: It is turn&#8217;d out of Townes and Cit-</line>
<line>ties for a dangerous thing, and euery man that means to</line>
<line>liue well, endeuours to tru&#383;t to him&#383;elfe, and liue with-</line>

<line>Where is the Euidence that doth accu&#383;e me?</line>
<line>What lawfull Que&#383;t haue giuen their Verdi&#392;t vp</line>

<line>The bitter &#383;entence of poore <nameref>Clarence</nameref> death,</line>
<line>Before I be conui&#392;t by cour&#383;e of Law?</line>
<line>To threaten me with death, is mo&#383;t vnlawfull.</line>

<line>Erroneous Va&#383;&#383;als, the great King of Kings</line>
<line>Hath in the Table of his Law commanded</line>
<line>That thou &#383;halt do no murther. Will you then</line>
<line>Spurne at his Edi&#392;t, and ful&#64257;ll a Mans?</line>
<line>Take heed: for he holds Vengeance in his hand,</line>
<line>To hurle vpon their heads that breake his Law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>And that &#383;ame Vengeance doth he hurle on thee,</line>
<line>For fal&#383;e For&#383;wearing, and for murther too:</line>
<line>Thou did&#8217;&#383;t receiue the Sacrament, to &#64257;ght</line>
<line>In quarrell of the Hou&#383;e of Lanca&#383;ter.</line>
