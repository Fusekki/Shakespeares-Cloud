<line>All tongues &#383;peake of him, and the bleared &#383;ights</line>
<line>Are &#383;pe&#392;tacled to &#383;ee him. Your pratling Nur&#383;e</line>
<line>Into a rapture lets her Baby crie,</line>

<line>Her riche&#383;t Lockram &#8217;bout her reechie necke,</line>

<line>D&#339; pre&#383;&#383;e among the popular Throngs, and puffe</line>
<line>To winne a vulgar &#383;tation: our veyl&#8217;d Dames</line>

<line>In their nicely gawded Cheekes, toth&#8217;wanton &#383;poyle</line>
<line>Of <nameref>Ph&#339;bus</nameref> burning Ki&#383;&#383;es: &#383;uch a poother,</line>
<line>As if that what&#383;&#339;uer God, who leades him,</line>
<line>Were &#383;lyly crept into his humane powers,</line>
<line>And gaue him gracefull po&#383;ture.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>On the &#383;uddaine, I warrant him Con&#383;ull.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>Then our Office may, during his power, g&#339;</line> 
<line>&#383;leepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>He cannot temp&#8217;rately tran&#383;port his Honors,</line>
<line>From where he &#383;hould begin, and end, but will</line>
<line>Lo&#383;e tho&#383;e he hath wonne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>In that there&#8217;s comfort.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scici.</speaker>
<line>Doubt not,</line>
<line>The Commoners, for whom we &#383;tand, but they</line>
<line>Vpon their ancient mallice, will forget</line>
<line>With the lea&#383;t cau&#383;e, the&#383;e his new Honors,</line>
<line>Which that he will giue them, make I as little que&#383;tion,</line>
<line>As he is prowd to doo&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>I heard him &#383;weare,</line>
<line>Were he to &#383;tand for Con&#383;ull, neuer would he</line>
<line>Appeare i&#8217;th&#8217;Market place, nor on him put</line>
<line>The Naples Ve&#383;ture of Humilitie,</line>
<line>Nor &#383;hewing (as the manner is) his Wounds</line>
<line>Toth&#8217; People, begge their &#383;tinking Breaths.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>It was his word:</line>
<line>Oh he would mi&#383;&#383;e it, rather then carry it,</line>
<line>But by the &#383;uite of the Gentry to him,</line>
<line>And the de&#383;ire of the Nobles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>I wi&#383;h no better, then haue him hold that pur-</line>
<line>po&#383;e, and to put it in execution.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis mo&#383;t like he will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>It &#383;hall be to him then, as our good wills; a</line> 
<line>&#383;ure destruction.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>So it mu&#383;t fall out</line>
<line>To him, or our Authorities, for an end.</line>
<line>We mu&#383;t &#383;ugge&#383;t the People, in what hatred</line>
<line>He &#383;till hath held them: that to&#8217;s power he would</line>
<line>Haue made them Mules, &#383;ilenc&#8217;d their Pleaders,</line>
<line>And di&#383;propertied their Freedomes; holding them,</line>
<line>In humane A&#392;tion, and Capacitie,</line>
<line>Of no more Soule, nor fitne&#383;&#383;e for the World,</line>
<line>Then Cammels in their Warre, who haue their Prouand</line>
<line>Onely for bearing Burthens, and &#383;ore blowes</line>
<line>For &#383;inking vnder them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin.</speaker>
<line>This (as you &#383;ay) &#383;ugge&#383;ted,</line>
<line>At &#383;ome time, when his &#383;oaring In&#383;olence</line>
<line>Shall teach the People, which time &#383;hall not want,</line>
<line>If he be put vpon&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s as ea&#383;ie,</line>
<line>As to &#383;et Dogges on Sheepe, will be his fire</line>
<line>To kindle their dry Stubble: and their Blaze</line>
<line>Shall darken him for euer.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Me&#383;&#383;enger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>You are &#383;ent for to the Capitoll:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis thought, that <nameref>Martius</nameref> &#383;hall be Con&#383;ull:</line>
<line>I haue &#383;eene the dumbe men throng to &#383;ee him,</line>
<line>And the blind to heare him &#383;peak: Matrons flong Gloues,</line>
<line>Ladies and Maids their Scarffes, and Handkerchers,</line>
<line>Vpon him as he pa&#383;s&#8217;d: the Nobles bended</line>
<line>As to <nameref>Ioues</nameref> Statue, and the Commons made</line>
<line>A Shower, and Thunder, with their Caps, and Showts:</line>
<line>I neuer &#383;aw the like.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s to the Capitoll,</line>
<line>And carry with vs Eares and Eyes for th&#8217;time,</line>
<line>But Hearts for the euent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Scicin</speaker>
<line>Haue with you.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter two Officers, to lay Cu&#383;hions, as it were, in the Capitoll.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Off.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, they are almo&#383;t here: how many</line> 
<line>&#383;tand for Con&#383;ul&#383;hips?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2.Off.</speaker>
<line>Three, they &#383;ay: but &#8217;tis thought of euery one,</line>
<line><nameref>Coriolanus</nameref> will carry it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Off.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a braue fellow: but hee&#8217;s vengeance</line> 
<line>prowd, and loues not the common people.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2.Off.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Faith, there hath beene many great men that</line> 
<line>haue flatter&#8217;d the people, who ne&#8217;re loued them; and there</line> 
<line>be many that they haue loued, they know not wherefore:</line> 
<line>&#383;o that if they loue they know not why, they hate vpon</line> 
<line>no better a ground. Therefore, for <nameref>Coriolanus</nameref> neyther to</line> 
<line>care whether they loue, or hate him, manife&#383;ts the true</line> 
<line>knowledge he ha&#8217;s in their di&#383;po&#383;ition, and out of his No-</line>
<line>ble carele&#383;ne&#383;&#383;e lets them plainely &#383;ee&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Off.</speaker>
<line>If he did not care whether he had their loue, or</line> 
<line>no, hee waued indifferently, &#8217;twixt doing them neyther</line> 
<line>good, nor harme: but hee &#383;eekes their hate with greater</line> 
<line>deuotion, then they can render it him; and leaues nothing</line> 
<line>vndone, that may fully di&#383;couer him their oppo&#383;ite. Now</line> 
<line>to &#383;eeme to affe&#392;t the mallice and di&#383;plea&#383;ure of the Peo-</line>
<line>ple, is as bad, as that which he di&#383;likes, to flatter them for</line> 
<line>their loue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2.Off.</speaker>
<line>Hee hath de&#383;erued worthily of his Countrey,</line> 
<line>and his a&#383;&#383;ent is not by &#383;uch ea&#383;ie degrees as tho&#383;e, who</line> 
<line>hauing beene &#383;upple and courteous to the People, Bon-</line>
<line>netted, without any further deed, to haue them at all into</line> 
<line>their e&#383;timation, and report: but hee hath &#383;o planted his</line> 
<line>Honors in their Eyes, and his a&#392;tions in their Hearts, that</line> 
<line>for their Tongues to be &#383;ilent, and not confe&#383;&#383;e &#383;o much,</line> 
<line>were a kinde of ingratefull Iniurie: to report otherwi&#383;e,</line> 
<line>were a Mallice, that giuing it &#383;elfe the Lye, would plucke</line> 
<line>reproofe and rebuke from euery Eare that heard it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Off.</speaker>
<line>No more of him, hee&#8217;s a worthy man: make</line> 
<line>way, they are comming.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>A Sennet. Enter the Patricians, and the Tribunes of the People, Li&#392;tors before them: Coriolanus, Menenius, Cominius the Con&#383;ul: Scicinius and Brutus take their places by them&#383;elues: Coriolanus &#383;tands.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Menen.</speaker>
<line>Hauing determin&#8217;d of the Volces,</line>

<line>As the maine Point of this our after-meeting,</line>

<line>A little of that worthy Worke, perform&#8217;d</line>
<line>By <nameref>Martius Caius Coriolanus</nameref>: whom</line>
<line>We met here, both to thanke, and to remember,</line>
<line>With Honors like him&#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Sen.</speaker>
<line>Speake, good <nameref>Cominius</nameref>:</line>

<line>hereto priz&#8217;d them at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Menen.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s off, that&#8217;s off: I would you rather had</line> 
<line>been &#383;ilent: Plea&#383;e you to heare <nameref>Cominius</nameref> &#383;peake?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>Mo&#383;t willingly: but yet my Caution was</line> 
<line>more pertinent then the rebuke you giue it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Menen.</speaker>
<line>He loues your People, but tye him not to be</line> 
<line>their Bed-fellow: Worthie <nameref>Cominius</nameref> &#383;peake.</line>

<line>I had rather haue my Wounds to heale againe,</line>
<line>Then heare &#383;ay how I got them.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Brutus.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I hope my words dis-bench&#8217;d you not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Coriol.</speaker>
<line>No Sir: yet oft,</line>
<line>When blowes haue made me &#383;tay, I fled from words.</line>
<line>You &#383;ooth&#8217;d not, therefore hurt not: but your People,</line>
<line>I loue them as they weigh&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Menen.</speaker>
<line>Pray now &#383;it downe.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Coriolanus</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Menen.</speaker>
<line>Ma&#383;ters of the People,</line>
<line>Your multiplying Spawne, how can he flatter?</line>
<line>That&#8217;s thou&#383;and to one good one, when you now &#383;ee</line>
<line>He had rather venture all his Limbes for Honor,</line>
<line>Then on ones Eares to heare it. Proceed <nameref>Cominius</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Com.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;hall lacke voyce: the deeds of <nameref>Coriolanus</nameref></line>
<line>Should not be vtter&#8217;d feebly: it is held,</line>
<line>That Valour is the chiefe&#383;t Vertue,</line>
<line>And mo&#383;t dignifies the hauer: if it be,</line>
<line>The man I &#383;peake of, cannot in the World</line>
<line>Be &#383;ingly counter-poys&#8217;d. At &#383;ixteene yeeres,</line>
<line>When <nameref>Tarquin</nameref> made a Head for Rome, he fought</line>
<line>Beyond the marke of others: our then Di&#392;tator,</line>
<line>Whom with all pray&#383;e I point at, &#383;aw him fight,</line>
<line>When with his Amazonian Shinne he droue</line>
<line>The brizled Lippes before him: he be&#383;trid</line>
<line>An o&#8217;re-pre&#383;t Roman, and i&#8217;th&#8217;Con&#383;uls view</line>
<line>Slew three Oppo&#383;ers: <nameref>Tarquins</nameref> &#383;elfe he met,</line>
<line>And &#383;trucke him on his Knee: in that dayes feates,</line>
<line>When he might a&#392;t the Woman in the Scene,</line>
<line>He prou&#8217;d be&#383;t man i&#8217;th&#8217;field, and for his meed</line>
<line>Was Brow-bound with the Oake. His Pupill age</line>
<line>Man-entred thus, he waxed like a Sea,</line>
<line>And in the brunt of &#383;euenteene Battailes &#383;ince,</line>
<line>He lurcht all Swords of the Garland: for this la&#383;t,</line>
<line>Before, and in Corioles, let me &#383;ay</line>

<line>Which thou &#383;hould&#8217;&#383;t beare me, only that name remains.</line>
<line>The Cruelty and Enuy of the people,</line>
<line>Permitted by our da&#383;tard Nobles, who</line>
<line>Haue all for&#383;ooke me, hath deuour&#8217;d the re&#383;t:</line>

<line>Hoop&#8217;d out of Rome. Now this extremity,</line>
<line>Hath brought me to thy Harth, not out of Hope</line>

<line>I had fear&#8217;d death, of all the Men i&#8217;th&#8217;World</line>
<line>I would haue voided thee. But in meere &#383;pight</line>

<line>Which not to cut, would &#383;hew thee but a Foole,</line>
<line>Since I haue euer followed thee with hate,</line>
<line>Drawne Tunnes of Blood out of thy Countries bre&#383;t,</line>

<line>By my hand, I had thoght to haue &#383;troken him with</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>Nay, I knew by his face that there was &#383;ome-thing</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He had &#383;o, looking as it were, would I were hang&#8217;d</line>

<stagedir>Enter the third Seruingman.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>3</speaker>
<line>Oh Slaues, I can tell you Newes, News you Ra&#383;cals</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Both.</speaker>
<line>What, what, what? Let&#8217;s partake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3</speaker>
<line>I would not be a Roman of all Nations; I had as</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Both.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore? Wherefore?</line>
</speech>

<line>Why here&#8217;s he that was wont to thwacke our Ge-</line>
<line>nerall, <nameref>Caius Martius</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>Why do you &#383;ay, thwacke our Generall?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3</speaker>
<line>I do not &#383;ay thwacke our Generall, but he was al-</line>
<line>wayes good enough for him</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>Come we are fellowes and friends: he was euer too</line> 
<line>hard for him, I haue heard him &#383;ay &#383;o him&#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He was too hard for him dire&#392;tly, to &#383;ay the Troth</line> 
<line>on&#8217;t before <nameref>Corioles</nameref>, he &#383;cotcht him, and notcht him like a</line> 
<line>Carbinado.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>And hee had bin Cannibally giuen, hee might haue</line>

<line>Why he is &#383;o made on heere within, as if hee were</line>

<line>que&#383;tion askt him by any of the Senators, but they &#383;tand</line> 
<line>bald before him. Our Generall him&#383;elfe makes a Mi&#383;tris</line> 
<line>of him, San&#392;tifies him&#383;elfe with&#8217;s hand, and turnes vp the</line> 
<line>white o&#8217;th&#8217;eye to his Di&#383;cour&#383;e. But the bottome of the</line> 
<line>Newes is, our Generall is cut i&#8217;th&#8217;middle, &amp; but one halfe</line> 
<line>of what he was ye&#383;terday. For the other ha&#8217;s halfe, by</line>

<line>&#383;ayes, and &#383;ole the Porter of Rome Gates by th&#8217;eares. He</line> 
<line>will mowe all downe before him, and leaue his pa&#383;&#383;age</line> 
<line>poul&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>And he&#8217;s as like to do&#8217;t, as any man I can imagine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3</speaker>
<line>Doo&#8217;t? he will doo&#8217;t: for look you &#383;ir, he has as ma-</line>
<line>ny Friends as Enemies: which Friends &#383;ir as it were, dur&#383;t</line> 
<line>not (looke you &#383;ir) &#383;hew them&#383;elues (as we terme it) his</line>

<line>De&#383;troy&#8217;d his Country, and his name remaines</line>

<line>To teare with Thunder the wide Cheekes a&#8217;th&#8217;Ayre,</line>

<line>Think&#8217;&#383;t thou it Honourable for a Nobleman</line>

<line>Perhaps thy childi&#383;hne&#383;&#383;e will moue him more</line>
<line>Then can our Rea&#383;ons. There&#8217;s no man in the world</line>
<line>More bound to&#8217;s Mother, yet heere he let&#8217;s me prate</line>

<line>like an Engine, and the ground &#383;hrinkes before his Trea-</line>
<line>ding. He is able to pierce a Cor&#383;let with his eye: Talkes</line> 
<line>like a knell, and his hum is a Battery. He &#383;its in his State,</line> 
<line>as a thing made for <nameref>Alexander</nameref>. What he bids bee done, is</line>

<line>I know it:</line>
<line>And my pretext to &#383;trike at him, admits</line>

<line>Mine Honor for his truth: who being &#383;o heighten&#8217;d,</line>
<line>He watered his new Plants with dewes of Flattery,</line>
<line>Seducing &#383;o my Friends: and to this end,</line>
<line>He bow&#8217;d his Nature, neuer knowne before,</line>

<line>Which he did end all his; and tooke &#383;ome pride</line>
<line>To do my &#383;elfe this wrong: Till at the la&#383;t</line>
<line>I &#383;eem&#8217;d his Follower, not Partner; and</line>

<line>At a few drops of Womens rhewme, which are</line> 
<line>As cheape as Lies; he &#383;old the Blood and Labour</line>

<line>And Ile renew me in his fall. But hearke.</line>
