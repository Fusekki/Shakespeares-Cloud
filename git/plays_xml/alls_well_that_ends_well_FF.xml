<line>You &#383;hall find of the King a husband Madame,</line>

<line>This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that</line>
<line>had, how &#383;ad a pa&#383;&#383;age tis, who&#383;e skill was almo&#383;t as</line>

<line>made nature immortall, and death &#383;hould haue play for</line>

<speaker>Laf.</speaker>
<line>How call&#8217;d you the man you &#383;peake of Madam?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Mo.</speaker>
<line>He was famous &#383;ir in his profe&#383;&#383;ion, and it was</line>
<line>his great right to be &#383;o: <nameref>Gerard de Narbon</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Laf.</speaker>
<line>He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very</line> 
<line>latelie &#383;poke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee</line> 
<line>was skilfull enough to haue liu&#8217;d &#383;til, if knowledge could</line>

<speaker>Ro&#383;.</speaker>
<line>I heard not of it before.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Laf.</speaker>
<line>I would it were not notorious. Was this Gen-</line>
<line>tlewoman the Daughter of <nameref>Gerard de Narbon</nameref>?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mo.</speaker>
<line>His &#383;ole childe my Lord, and bequeathed to my</line>
<line>ouer looking. I haue tho&#383;e hopes of her good, that her</line> 
<line>education promi&#383;es her di&#383;po&#383;itions &#383;hee inherits,</line> 
<line>which makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind car-</line>
<line>ries vertuous qualities, there commendations go with</line> 
<line>pitty, they are vertues and traitors too: in her they are</line> 
<line>the better for their &#383;implene&#383;&#383;e; &#383;he deriues her hone&#383;tie,</line>

<speaker>Mo.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis the be&#383;t brine a Maiden can &#383;ea&#383;on her prai&#383;e</line>
<line>in. The remembrance of her father neuer approches her</line> 
<line>heart, but the tirrany of her &#383;orrowes takes all liuelihood</line> 
<line>from her cheeke. No more of this <nameref>Helena</nameref>, go too, no</line> 
<line>more lea&#383;t it be rather thought you affe&#392;t a &#383;orrow, then</line>

<line>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</line>

<speaker>Mo.</speaker>
<line>If the liuing be enemie to the greefe, the exce&#383;&#383;e</line>

<line>Farewell prettie Lady, you mu&#383;t hold the cre-</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Hell.</speaker>
<line>O were that all, I thinke not on my father,</line>
<line>And the&#383;e great teares grace his remembrance more</line>
<line>Then tho&#383;e I &#383;hed for him. What was he like?</line>
<line>I haue forgott him. My imagination</line>
<line>Carries no fauour in&#8217;t but <nameref>Bertrams</nameref>.</line>
<line>I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,</line>
<line>If <nameref>Bertram</nameref> be away. &#8217;Twere all one,</line>
<line>That I &#383;hould loue a bright particuler &#383;tarre,</line>
<line>And think to wed it, he is &#383;o aboue me</line>
<line>In his bright radience and colaterall light,</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t I be comforted, not in his &#383;phere;</line>
<line>Th&#8217; ambition in my loue thus plagues it &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>The hind that would be mated by the Lion</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t die for loue. &#8217;Twas prettie, though a plague</line>
<line>To &#383;ee him euerie houre to &#383;it and draw</line>
<line>His arched browes, his hawking eie, his curles</line>
<line>In our hearts table: heart too capeable</line>
<line>Of euerie line and tricke of his &#383;weet fauour.</line>
<line>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancie</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t &#383;an&#392;ti&#64257;e his Reliques. Who comes heere?</line>
<line><stagedir>Enter Parrolles.</stagedir></line>
<line>One that goes with him: I loue him for his &#383;ake,</line>
<line>And yet I know him a notorious Liar,</line>
<line>Thinke him a great way foole, &#383;olie a coward,</line>
<line>Yet the&#383;e fixt euils &#383;it &#383;o fit in him,</line>
<line>That they take place, when Vertues &#383;teely bones</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>Saue you faire Queene.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>And you Monarch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>No.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>And no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>Are you meditating on virginitie?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>I: you haue &#383;ome &#383;taine of &#383;ouldier in you: Let</line> 
<line>mee aske you a que&#383;tion. Man is enemie to virginitie,</line>
<line>how may we barracado it again&#383;t him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>Keepe him out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>But he a&#383;&#383;ailes, and our virginitie though vali-</line>
<line>ant, in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs &#383;ome war-</line>
<line>like re&#383;i&#383;tance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>There is none: Man &#383;etting downe before you,</line>
<line>will vndermine you, and blow you vp.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>Ble&#383;&#383;e our poore Virginity from vnderminers</line>
<line>and blowers vp. Is there no Military policy how Vir-</line>
<line>gins might blow vp men?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will</line> 
<line>quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe</line> 
<line>againe, with the breach your &#383;elues made, you lo&#383;e your</line> 
<line>Citty. It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of</line> 
<line>Nature, to pre&#383;erue virginity. Lo&#383;&#383;e of Virginitie, is</line> 
<line>rationall encrea&#383;e, and there was neuer Virgin g&#339;, till</line> 
<line>virginitie was fir&#383;t lo&#383;t. That you were made of, is met-</line>
<line>tall to make Virgins. Virginitie, by beeing once lo&#383;t,</line> 
<line>may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer</line> 
<line>lo&#383;t: &#8216;tis too cold a companion: Away with&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>I will &#383;tand for&#8217;t a little, though therefore I die</line>
<line>a Virgin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s little can bee &#383;aide in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis again&#383;t the</line>
<line>rule of Nature. To &#383;peake on the part of virginitie, is</line>
<line>to accu&#383;e your Mothers; which is mo&#8217;t infallible di&#383;o-</line>
<line>bedience. He that hangs him&#383;elfe is a Virgin: Virgini-</line>
<line>tie murthers it &#383;elfe, and &#383;hould be buried in highwayes</line> 
<line>out of all &#383;an&#392;tified limit, as a de&#383;perate Offendre&#383;&#383;e a-</line>
<line>gain&#383;t Nature. Virginitie breedes mites, much like a</line>
<line>Chee&#383;e, con&#383;umes it &#383;elfe to the very payring, and &#383;o</line> 
<line>dies with feeding his owne &#383;tomacke. Be&#383;ides, Virgini-</line>
<line>tie is peeui&#383;h, proud, ydle, made of &#383;elfe-loue, which</line>
<line>which is the mo&#383;t inhibited &#383;inne in the Cannon. Keepe it not,</line>
<line>you cannot choo&#383;e but loo&#383;e by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t: within</line> 
<line>ten yeare it will make it &#383;elfe two, which is a goodly in-</line>
<line>crea&#383;e, and the principall it &#383;elfe not much the wor&#383;e.</line> 
<line>Away with&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>How might one do &#383;ir, to loo&#383;e it to her owne</line> 
<line>liking?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Par.</speaker>
<line>Let mee &#383;ee. Marry ill, to like him that ne&#8217;re</line>
<line>it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity wil lose the glo&#383;&#383;e with lying:</line>
<line>The longer kept, the le&#383;&#383;e worth: Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis</line>
<line>vendible. An&#383;wer the time of reque&#383;t, Virginitie like</line> 
<line>an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fa&#383;hion, richly</line>
<line>&#383;uted, but vn&#383;uteable, iu&#383;t like the brooch &amp; the tooth-</line>
<line>pick, which were not now: your Date is better in your</line> 
<line>Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your</line>
<line>virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French</line>
<line>wither&#8217;d peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry &#8217;tis a</line> 
<line>wither&#8217;d peare: it was formerly better, marry yet &#8217;tis a</line>
<line>wither&#8217;d peare: Will you any thing with it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hel.</speaker>
<line>Not my virginity yet:</line>
<line>There &#383;hall your Ma&#383;ter haue a thou&#383;and loues,</line>
<line>A Mother, and a Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;e, and a friend,</line>
<line>A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,</line>
<line>A guide, a Godde&#383;&#383;e, and a Soueraigne,</line>
<line>A Coun&#383;ellor, a Traitore&#383;&#383;e, and a Deare:</line>
<line>His humble ambition, proud humility:</line>
<line>His iarring, concord: and his di&#383;cord, dulcet:</line>
<line>His faith, his &#383;weet di&#383;a&#383;ter: with a world</line>
<line>Of pretty fond adoptious chri&#383;tendomes</line>
<line>That blinking Cupid go&#383;&#383;ips. Now &#383;hall he:</line>
