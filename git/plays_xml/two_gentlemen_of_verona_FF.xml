<line>I will.</line>

<line>So the remembrance of my former Loue</line>

<line>Which like a waxen Image &#8217;gain&#383;t a fire</line>
<line>Beares no impre&#383;&#383;ion of the thing it was.)</line>
<line>Me thinkes my zeale to <nameref>Valentine</nameref> is cold,</line>
<line>And that I loue him not as I was wont:</line>
<line>O, but I loue his Lady too-too much,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s the rea&#383;on I loue him &#383;o little.</line>
<line>How &#383;hall I doate on her with more aduice,</line>
<line>That thus without aduice begin to loue her?</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but her pi&#392;ture I haue yet beheld,</line>
<line>And that hath dazel&#8217;d my rea&#383;ons light:</line>
<line>But when I looke on her perfe&#392;tions,</line>
<line>There is no rea&#383;on, but I &#383;hall be blinde.</line>

<line>My gracious Lord, that which I wold di&#383;couer,</line>

<line>But when I call to minde your gracious fauours</line>
<line>Done to me (vnde&#383;eruing as I am)</line>
<line>My dutie pricks me on to vtter that</line>
<line>Which el&#383;e, no worldly good &#383;hould draw from me:</line>
<line>Know (worthy Prince) Sir <nameref>Valentine</nameref> my friend</line>
<line>This night intends to &#383;teale away your daughter:</line>

<line>Knowing that tender youth is &#383;oone &#383;ugge&#383;ted,</line>
<line>I nightly lodge her in an vpper Towre,</line>

<line>No, tru&#383;t me, She is peeui&#383;h, &#383;ullen, froward,</line>
<line>Prowd, di&#383;obedient, &#383;tubborne, lacking duty,</line>
<line>Neither regarding that &#383;he is my childe,</line>
<line>Nor fearing me, as if I were her father:</line>
<line>And may I &#383;ay to thee, this pride of hers</line>
<line>(Vpon aduice) hath drawne my loue from her,</line>
<line>And where I thought the remnant of mine age</line>
<line>Should haue beene cheri&#383;h&#8217;d by her child-like dutie,</line>
<line>I now am full re&#383;olu&#8217;d to take a wife,</line>
<line>And turne her out, to who will take her in:</line>
<line>Then let her beauty be her wedding dowre:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>There is a Lady in <nameref>Verona</nameref> heere</line>
<line>Whom I affe&#392;t: but &#383;he is nice, and coy,</line>
<line>And naught e&#383;teemes my aged eloquence.</line>
<line>Now therefore would I haue thee to my Tutor</line>
<line>(For long agone I haue forgot to court,</line>
<line>Be&#383;ides the fa&#383;hion of the time is chang&#8217;d)</line>
<line>How, and which way I may be&#383;tow my &#383;elfe</line>
<line>To be regarded in her &#383;un-bright eye.</line>

<speech>

<line>Win her with gifts, if &#383;he re&#383;pe&#392;t not words,</line>

<line>More then quicke words, doe moue a womans minde.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>A woman &#383;omtime &#383;corns what be&#383;t c&#333;tents her.</line>
<line>Send her another: neuer giue her ore,</line>
<line>For &#383;corne at fir&#383;t, makes after-loue the more.</line>
<line>If &#383;he doe frowne, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,</line>
<line>But rather to beget more loue in you.</line>
<line>If &#383;he doe chide, &#8217;tis not to haue you gone,</line>
<line>For why, the fooles are mad, if left alone.</line>
<line>Take no repul&#383;e, what euer &#383;he doth &#383;ay,</line>
<line>For, get you gon, &#383;he doth not meane away.</line>
<line>Flatter, and prai&#383;e, commend, extoll their graces:</line>
<line>Though nere &#383;o blacke, &#383;ay they haue Angells faces,</line>
<line>That man that hath a tongue, I &#383;ay is no man,</line>
<line>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>But &#383;he I meane, is promis&#8217;d by her friends</line>
<line>Vnto a youthfull Gentleman of worth,</line>
<line>And kept &#383;euerely from re&#383;ort of men,</line>
<line>That no man hath acce&#383;&#383;e by day to her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>Why then I would re&#383;ort to her by night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>I, but the doores be lockt, and keyes kept &#383;afe,</line>
<line>That no man hath recour&#383;e to her by night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>What letts but one may enter at her window?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</line>
<line>And built &#383;o &#383;heluing, that one cannot climbe it</line>
<line>Without apparant hazard of his life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>Why then a Ladder quaintly made of Cords</line>
<line>To ca&#383;t vp, with a paire of anchoring hookes,</line>
<line>Would &#383;erue to &#383;cale another <nameref>Hero&#8217;s</nameref> towre,</line>
<line>So bold <nameref>Leander</nameref> would aduenture it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>Now as thou art a Gentleman of blood</line>
<line>Adui&#383;e me, where I may haue &#383;uch a Ladder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>When would you v&#383;e it? pray &#383;ir, tell me that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>This very night; for Loue is like a childe</line>
<line>That longs for euery thing that he can come by.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>By &#383;eauen a clock, ile get you &#383;uch a Ladder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk</speaker>
<line>But harke thee: I will goe to her alone,</line>
<line>How &#383;hall I be&#383;t conuey the Ladder thither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>It will be light (my Lord) that you may beare it</line>
<line>Vnder a cloake, that is of any length.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>A cloake as long as thine will &#383;erue the turne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Val.</speaker>
<line>I my good Lord.</line>

<line>Di&#383;&#383;olues to water, and doth loo&#383;e his forme.</line>
<line>A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,</line>

<line>How now &#383;ir <nameref>Protheus</nameref>, is your countriman</line>
<line>(According to our Proclamation) gon?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>Gon, my good Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>My daughter takes his going grieuously?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>A little time (my Lord) will kill that griefe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>So I beleeue: but <nameref>Thurio</nameref> thinkes not &#383;o:</line>
<line><nameref>Protheus</nameref>, the good conceit I hold of thee,</line>
<line>(For thou ha&#383;t &#383;howne &#383;ome &#383;igne of good de&#383;ert)</line>
<line>Makes me the better to confer with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>Longer then I proue loyall to your Grace,</line>
<line>Let me not liue, to looke vpon your Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>Thou know&#8217;&#383;t how willingly, I would effe&#392;t</line>
<line>The match betweene &#383;ir <nameref>Thurio</nameref>, and my daughter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>I doe my Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>And also, I thinke, thou art not ignorant</line>
<line>How &#383;he oppo&#383;es her again&#383;t my will?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>She did my Lord, when <nameref>Valentine</nameref> was here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>I, and peruer&#383;ly, &#383;he per&#383;euers &#383;o:</line>
<line>What might we doe to make the girle forget</line>
<line>The loue of <nameref>Valentine</nameref>, and loue &#383;ir <nameref>Thurio</nameref>?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>The be&#383;t way is, to &#383;lander <nameref>Valentine</nameref>,</line>
<line>With fal&#383;ehood, cowardize, and poore di&#383;cent:</line>
<line>Three things, that women highly hold in hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>I, but &#383;he&#8217;ll thinke, that it is &#383;poke in hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>I, if his enemy deliuer it.</line>
<line>Therefore it mu&#383;t with circum&#383;tance be &#383;poken</line>
<line>By one, whom &#383;he e&#383;teemeth as his friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>Then you mu&#383;t vndertake to &#383;lander him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>And that (my Lord) I &#383;hall be loath to doe:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis an ill office for a Gentleman,</line>
<line>E&#383;pecially again&#383;t his very friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>Where your good word cannot aduantage him,</line>
<line>Your &#383;lander neuer can endamage him;</line>
<line>Therefore the office is indifferent,</line>
<line>Being intreated to it by your friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>You haue preuail&#8217;d (my Lord) if I can doe it</line>
<line>By ought that I can &#383;peake in his di&#383;prai&#383;e,</line>
<line>She &#383;hall not long continue loue to him:</line>
<line>But &#383;ay this weede her loue from <nameref>Valentine</nameref>,</line>
<line>It followes not that &#383;he will loue &#383;ir <nameref>Thurio</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Th.</speaker>
<line>Therefore, as you vnwinde her loue from him;</line>
<line>Lea&#383;t it &#383;hould rauell, and be good to none,</line>
<line>You mu&#383;t prouide to bottome it on me:</line>
<line>Which mu&#383;t be done, by prai&#383;ing me as much</line>
<line>As you, in worth di&#383;prai&#383;e, &#383;ir <nameref>Valentine</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>And <nameref>Protheus</nameref>, we dare tru&#383;t you in this kinde,</line>
<line>Becau&#383;e we know (on <nameref>Valentines</nameref> report)</line>
<line>You are already loues firme votary,</line>
<line>And cannot &#383;oone reuolt, and change your minde.</line>
<line>Vpon this warrant, &#383;hall you haue acce&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Where you, with <nameref>Siluia</nameref>, may conferre at large.</line>
<line>For &#383;he is lumpi&#383;h, heauy, mellancholly,</line>
<line>And (for your friends &#383;ake) will be glad of you;</line>
<line>Where you may temper her, by your per&#383;wa&#383;ion,</line>
<line>To hate yong <nameref>Valentine</nameref>, and loue my friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>As much as I can doe, I will effe&#392;t:</line>
<line>But you &#383;ir <nameref>Thurio</nameref>, are not &#383;harpe enough:</line>
<line>You mu&#383;t lay Lime, to tangle her de&#383;ires</line>
<line>By walefull Sonnets, who&#383;e compo&#383;ed Rimes</line>
<line>Should be full fraught with &#383;eruiceable vowes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Du.</speaker>
<line>I, much is the force of heauen-bred Poe&#383;ie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>Say that vpon the altar of her beauty</line>
<line>You &#383;acrifice your teares, your &#383;ighes, your heart:</line>

<line>But I can make re&#383;pe&#392;tiue in my &#383;elfe?</line>
<line>If this fond Loue, were not a blinded god.</line>
<line>Come &#383;hadow, come, and take this &#383;hadow vp,</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis thy riuall: O thou &#383;encele&#383;&#383;e forme,</line>
