<line>That are without him; as place, riches, and fauour,</line>

<line>How much in hauing, or without, or in,</line>
<line>Cannot make boa&#383;t to haue that which he hath;</line>
<line>Nor feeles not what he owes, but by refle&#392;tion:</line>

<line>This is not &#383;trange <nameref>Vli&#383;&#383;es</nameref>:</line>

<line>The bearer knowes not, but commends it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Not going from it &#383;elfe: but eye to eye oppos&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Salutes each other with each others forme.</line>
<line>For &#383;peculation turnes not to it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Till it hath trauail&#8217;d, and is married there</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Vli&#383;.</speaker>
<line>I doe not &#383;traine it at the po&#383;ition,</line>

<line>Nor doth he of him&#383;elfe know them for ought,</line>
<line>Till he behold them formed in th&#8217; applau&#383;e,</line>
<line>Where they are extended: who like an arch reuerb&#8217;rate</line>
<line>The voyce againe; or like a gate of &#383;teele,</line>
<line>Fronting the Sunne, receiues and renders backe</line>
<line>His figure, and his heate. I was much rapt in this,</line>
<line>And apprehended here immediately:</line>
<line>The vnknowne <nameref>Aiax</nameref>;</line>
<line>Heauens what a man is there? a very Hor&#383;e,</line>
<line>That has he knowes not what. Nature, what things there are.</line>

<line>How &#383;ome men creepe in skitti&#383;h fortunes hall,</line>
<line>Whiles others play the Ideots in her eyes:</line>
<line>How one man eates into anothers pride,</line>
<line>While pride is fea&#383;ting in his wantonne&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>To &#383;ee the&#383;e Grecian Lords; why, euen already,</line>
<line>They clap the lubber <nameref>Aiax</nameref> on the &#383;houlder,</line>
<line>As if his foote were on braue <nameref>He&#392;tors</nameref> bre&#383;t,</line>

<line>Keepes honor bright, to haue done, is to hang</line>

<line>Lye there for pauement to the abie&#392;t, neere</line>
<line>Ore-run and trampled on: then what they doe in pre&#383;ent,</line>

<line>That &#383;lightly &#383;hakes his parting Gue&#383;t by th&#8217; hand;</line>
<line>And with his armes out-&#383;tretcht, as he would flye,</line>
