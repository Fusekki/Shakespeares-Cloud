<line>An vntimely Ague</line>
<line>Staid me a Pri&#383;oner in my Chamber, when</line>
<line>Tho&#383;e Sunnes of Glory, tho&#383;e two Lights of Men</line>
<line>Met in the vale of Andren.</line>

<line>Then you lo&#383;t</line>
<line>The view of earthly glory: Men might &#383;ay</line>
<line>Till this time Pompe was &#383;ingle, but now married</line>

<line>Became the next dayes ma&#383;ter, till the la&#383;t</line>

<line>All Clinquant all in Gold, like Heathen Gods</line>
<line>Shone downe the Engli&#383;h; and to morrow, they</line>
<line>Made Britaine, India: Euery man that &#383;tood,</line>

<line>The Pride vpon them, that their very labour</line>

<line>Was cry&#8217;de incompareable; and th&#8217; en&#383;uing night</line>
<line>Made it a Foole, and Begger. The two Kings</line>

<line>All this was ordred by the good Di&#383;cretion</line>
<line>Of the right Reuerend Cardinall of Yorke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>The diuell &#383;peed him: No mans Pye is freed</line>
<line>From his Ambitious finger. What had he</line>
<line>To do in the&#383;e fierce Vanities? I wonder,</line>
<line>That &#383;uch a Keech can with his very bulke</line>
<line>Take vp the Rayes o&#8217;th&#8217;beneficiall Sun,</line>
<line>And keepe it from the Earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nor.</speaker>
<line>Surely Sir,</line>
<line>There&#8217;s in him &#383;tuffe, that put&#8217;s him to the&#383;e ends:</line>
<line>For being not propt by Aunce&#383;try, who&#383;e grace</line>
<line>Chalkes Succe&#383;&#383;ors their way; nor call&#8217;d vpon</line>
<line>For high feats done to&#8217;th&#8217;Crowne; neither Allied</line>
<line>To eminent A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tants; but Spider-like</line>
<line>Out of his Selfe-drawing Web. O giues vs note,</line>
<line>The force of his owne merit makes his way</line>
<line>A guift that heauen giues for him, which buyes</line>
<line>A place next to the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Abur.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell</line>
<line>What Heauen hath giuen him: let &#383;ome Grauer eye</line>
<line>Pierce into that, but I can &#383;ee his Pride</line>
<line>Peepe through each part of him: whence ha&#8217;s he that,</line>
<line>If not from Hell? The Diuell is a Niggard,</line>
<line>Or ha&#8217;s giuen all before, and he begins</line>
<line>A new Hell in him&#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>Why the Diuell,</line>
<line>Vpon this French going out, tooke he vpon him</line>
<line>(Without the priuity o&#8217;th&#8217;King) t&#8217;appoint</line>
<line>Who &#383;hould attend on him? He makes vp the File</line>
<line>Of all the Gentry; for the mo&#383;t part &#383;uch</line>
<line>To whom as great a Charge, as little Honor</line>
<line>He meant to lay vpon: and his owne Letter</line>
<line>The Honourable Boord of Councell, out</line>
<line>Mu&#383;t fetch him in, he Papers.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>O many</line>
<line>Haue broke their backes with laying Mannors on &#8217;em</line>
<line>For this great Iourney. What did this vanity</line>
<line>But mini&#383;ter communication of</line>
<line>A mo&#383;t poore i&#383;&#383;ue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nor.</speaker>
<line>Greeuingly I thinke,</line>
<line>The Peace betweene the French and vs, not valewes</line>
<line>The Co&#383;t that did conclude it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>Euery man,</line>
<line>After the hideous &#383;torme that follow&#8217;d, was</line>
<line>A thing In&#383;pir&#8217;d, and not con&#383;ulting, broke</line>
<line>Into a generall Prophe&#383;ie; That this Tempe&#383;t</line>

<line>Like it your Grace,</line>

<line>Honor, and plenteous &#383;afety) that you reade</line>

<line>Together; To con&#383;ider further, that</line>
<line>What his high Hatred would effe&#392;t, wants not</line>

<line>Has done this, and tis well: for worthy <nameref>Wol&#383;ey</nameref></line>
<line>(Who cannot erre) he did it. Now this followes,</line>
<line>(Which as I take it, is a kinde of Puppie</line>
<line>To th&#8217;old dam Trea&#383;on) <nameref>Charles</nameref> the Emperour,</line>

<line>Peep&#8217;d harmes that menac&#8217;d him. Priuily</line>

<line>Which I doe well; for I am &#383;ure the Emperour</line>
<line>Paid ere he promis&#8217;d, whereby his Suit was granted</line>
<line>Ere it was ask&#8217;d. But when the way was made</line>
<line>And pau&#8217;d with gold: the Emperor thus de&#383;ir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That he would plea&#383;e to alter the Kings cour&#383;e,</line>
<line>And breake the fore&#383;aid peace. Let the King know</line>

<line>I am much too venturous</line>

<line>Without delay; and the pretence for this</line>
<line>Is nam&#8217;d, your warres in France: this makes bold mouths,</line>
<line>Tongues &#383;pit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</line>
<line>Allegeance in them; their cur&#383;es now</line>
<line>Liue where their prayers did: and it&#8217;s come to pa&#383;&#383;e,</line>

<line>But will you be more iu&#383;tifi&#8217;de? You euer</line>
<line>Haue wi&#383;h&#8217;d the &#383;leeping of this bu&#383;ines, neuer de&#383;ir&#8217;d</line>

<line>Now, what mou&#8217;d me too&#8217;t,</line>
<line>I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
<line>Then marke th&#8217; inducement. Thus it came; giue heede too&#8217;t:</line>
<line>My Con&#383;cience fir&#383;t receiu&#8217;d a tendernes,</line>
<line>Scruple, and pricke, on certaine Speeches vtter&#8217;d</line>
<line>By th&#8217; Bi&#383;hop of <nameref>Bayon</nameref>, then French Emba&#383;&#383;ador,</line>
<line>Who had beene hither &#383;ent on the debating</line>
<line>And Marriage &#8217;twixt the Duke of <nameref>Orleance</nameref>, and</line>
<line>Our Daughter <nameref>Mary</nameref>: I&#8217;th&#8217; Progre&#383;&#383;e of this bu&#383;ines,</line>
<line>Ere a determinate re&#383;olution, hee</line>
<line>(I meane the Bi&#383;hop) did require a re&#383;pite,</line>
<line>Wherein he might the King his Lord aduerti&#383;e,</line>
<line>Whether our Daughter were legitimate,</line>
<line>Re&#383;pe&#392;ting this our Marriage with the Dowager,</line>
<line>Sometimes our Brothers Wife. This re&#383;pite &#383;hooke</line>
<line>The bo&#383;ome of my Con&#383;cience, enter&#8217;d me;</line>
<line>Yea, with a &#383;pitting power, and made to tremble</line>
<line>The region of my Brea&#383;t, which forc&#8217;d &#383;uch way,</line>
<line>That many maz&#8217;d con&#383;iderings, did throng</line>
<line>And pre&#383;t in with this Caution. Fir&#383;t, me thought</line>
<line>I &#383;tood not in the &#383;mile of Heauen, who had</line>
<line>Commanded Nature, that my Ladies wombe</line>
<line>If it conceiu&#8217;d a male-child by me, &#383;hould</line>
<line>Doe no more Offices of life too&#8217;t; then</line>
<line>The Graue does to th&#8217; dead: For her Male I&#383;&#383;ue,</line>
<line>Or di&#8217;de where they were made, or &#383;hortly after</line>
<line>This world had ayr&#8217;d them. Hence I tooke a thought,</line>
<line>This was a Iudgement on me, that my Kingdome</line>
<line>(Well worthy the be&#383;t Heyre o&#8217;th&#8217; World) &#383;hould not</line>
<line>Be gladded in&#8217;t by me. Then followes, that</line>
<line>I weigh&#8217;d the danger which my Realmes &#383;tood in</line>
<line>By this my I&#383;&#383;ues faile, and that gaue to me</line>
<line>Many a groaning throw: thus hulling in</line>
<line>The wild Sea of my Con&#383;cience, I did &#383;teere</line>
<line>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
<line>Now pre&#383;ent heere together: that&#8217;s to &#383;ay,</line>
<line>I meant to re&#392;tifie my Con&#383;cience, which</line>
<line>I then did feele full &#383;icke, and yet not well,</line>
<line>By all the Reuerend Fathers of the Land,</line>
<line>And Do&#392;tors learn&#8217;d. Fir&#383;t I began in priuate,</line>

<line>He would &#383;ay vntruths, and be euer double</line>
<line>Both in his words, and meaning. He was neuer</line>

<line>His Promi&#383;es, were as he then was, Mighty:</line>
<line>But his performance, as he is now, Nothing:</line>
