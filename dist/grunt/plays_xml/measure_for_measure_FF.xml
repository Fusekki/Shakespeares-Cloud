<line>The &#383;malle&#383;t &#383;cruple of her excellence,</line>

<speaker>2. Gent.</speaker>
<line>Amen.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Thou conclud&#8217;&#383;t like the San&#392;timonious Pirat,</line>

<line>full feeling of thy &#383;peech: I will, out of thine owne con-</line>
<line>fe&#383;&#383;ion, learne to begin thy health; but, whil&#383;t I liue for-</line>
<line>get to drinke after thee.</line>

<line>Plea&#383;&#8217;d you to doo&#8217;t, at perill of your &#383;oule</line>
<line>Were equall poize of &#383;inne, and charitie.</line>

<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>
<line>That I do beg his life, if it be &#383;inne</line>
<line>Heauen let me beare it: you granting of my &#383;uit,</line>

<line>Admit no other way to &#383;aue his life</line>

<line>Who&#383;e creadit with the Iudge, or owne great place,</line>
<line>Could fetch your Brother from the Manacles</line>
<line>Of the all-building-Law: and that there were</line>
<line>No earthly meane to &#383;aue him, but that either</line>
<line>You mu&#383;t lay downe the trea&#383;ures of your body,</line>
<line>To this &#383;uppo&#383;ed, or el&#383;e to let him &#383;u&#64256;er:</line>
<line>What would you doe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>
<line>As much for my poore Brother, as my &#383;elfe;</line>
<line>That is: were I vnder the tearmes of death,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; impre&#383;&#383;ion of keene whips, I&#8217;ld weare as Rubies,</line>
<line>And &#383;trip my &#383;elfe to death, as to a bed,</line>
<line>That longing haue bin &#383;icke for, ere I&#8217;ld yeeld</line>
<line>My body vp to &#383;hame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>Then mu&#383;t your brother die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;a.</speaker>
<line>And &#8217;twer the cheaper way:</line>
<line>Better it were a brother dide at once,</line>
<line>Then that a &#383;i&#383;ter, by redeeming him</line>
<line>Should die for euer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>Were not you then as cruell as the Sentence,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;a.</speaker>
<line>Ignomie in ran&#383;ome, and free pardon</line>
<line>Are of two hou&#383;es: lawfull mercie,</line>
<line>Is nothing kin to fowle redemption.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;eem&#8217;d of late to make the Law a tirant,</line>
<line>And rather prou&#8217;d the &#383;liding of your brother</line>
<line>A merriment, then a vice.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;a.</speaker>
<line>Oh pardon me my Lord, it oft fals out</line>

<line>Brother?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>
<line>I am now going to re&#383;olue him: I had rather</line>
<line>my brother die by the Law, then my &#383;onne &#383;hould be vn-</line>

<line>deceiu&#8217;d in <nameref>Angelo</nameref>: if euer he returne, and I can &#383;peake</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Shee &#383;hould this <nameref>Angelo</nameref> haue married: was af-</line>
<line>&#64257;anced to her oath, and the nuptiall appointed: between</line>
<line>which time of the contra&#392;t, and limit of the &#383;olemnitie,</line>
<line>her brother <nameref>Fredericke</nameref> was wrackt at Sea, hauing in that</line>
<line>peri&#383;hed ve&#383;&#383;ell, the dowry of his &#383;i&#383;ter: but marke how</line>
<line>heauily this befell to the poore Gentlewoman, there &#383;he</line>

<line>her, euer mo&#383;t kinde and naturall: with him the portion</line>

<line>Can this be &#383;o? did <nameref>Angelo</nameref> &#383;o leaue her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Left her in her teares, &amp; dried not one of them</line>
<line>with his comfort: &#383;wallowed his vowes whole, preten-</line>
<line>ding in her, di&#383;coueries of di&#383;honor: in few, be&#383;tow&#8217;d</line>
<line>her on her owne lamentation, which &#383;he yet weares for</line>
<line>his &#383;ake: and he, a marble to her teares, is wa&#383;hed with</line>
<line>them, but relents not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>
<line>What a merit were it in death to take this poore</line>
<line>maid from the world? what corruption in this life, that</line>
<line>it will let this man liue? But how out of this can &#383;hee a-</line>
<line>uaile?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>It is a rupture that you may ea&#383;ily heale: and the</line>
<line>cure of it not onely &#383;aues your brother, but keepes you</line>
<line>from di&#383;honor in doing it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>

<line>This fore-named Maid hath yet in her the con-</line>
<line>tinuance of her &#64257;r&#383;t a&#64256;e&#392;tion: his vniu&#383;t vnkindene&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>(that in all rea&#383;on &#383;hould haue quenched her loue) hath</line>
<line>(like an impediment in the Current) made it more vio-</line>
<line>lent and vnruly: Goe you to <nameref>Angelo</nameref>, an&#383;were his requi-</line>
<line>ring with a plau&#383;ible obedience, agree with his demands</line>
<line>to the point: onely referre your &#383;elfe to this aduantage;</line>
<line>&#64257;r&#383;t, that your &#383;tay with him may not be long: that the</line>
<line>time may haue all &#383;hadow, and &#383;ilence in it: and the place</line>
<line>an&#383;were to conuenience: this being granted in cour&#383;e,</line>
<line>and now followes all: wee &#383;hall adui&#383;e this wronged</line>
<line>maid to &#383;teed vp your appointment, goe in your place:</line>
<line>if the encounter acknowledge it &#383;elfe heereafter, it may</line>
<line>compell him to her recompence; and heere, by this is</line>
<line>your brother &#383;aued, your honor vntainted, the poore</line>
<line><nameref>Mariana</nameref> aduantaged, and the corrupt Deputy &#383;caled.</line>
<line>The Maid will I frame, and make &#64257;t for his attempt: if</line>
<line>you thinke well to carry this as you may, the doublenes</line>
<line>of the bene&#64257;t defends the deceit from reproofe. What</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>I know none: can you tell me of any?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Some &#383;ay he is with the Emperor of <nameref>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</nameref>: other</line>
<line>&#383;ome, he is in <nameref>Rome</nameref>: but where is he thinke you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>I know not where: but where&#383;oeuer, I wi&#383;h</line>
<line>him well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>It was a mad fanta&#383;ticall tricke of him to &#383;teale</line>
<line>from the State, and v&#383;urpe the beggerie hee was neuer</line>
<line>borne to: Lord <nameref>Angelo</nameref> Dukes it well in his ab&#383;ence: he</line>
<line>puts tran&#383;gre&#383;&#383;ion too&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>He do&#8217;s well in&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>A little more lenitie to Lecherie would doe no</line>
<line>harme in him: Something too crabbed that way, <italic>Frier</italic>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>It is too general a vice, and &#383;eueritie mu&#383;t cure it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Yes in good &#383;ooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</line>
<line>it is vvell allied, but it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to extirpe it quite,</line>
<line>Frier, till eating and drinking be put downe. They &#383;ay</line>
<line>this <nameref>Angelo</nameref> vvas not made by Man and Woman, after</line>
<line>this downe-right vvay of Creation: is it true, thinke</line>
<line>you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>How &#383;hould he be made then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Some report, a Sea-maid &#383;pawn&#8217;d him. Some,</line>
<line>that he vvas begot betweene two Stock-&#64257;&#383;hes. But it</line>
<line>is certaine, that when he makes water, his Vrine is con-</line>
<line>geal&#8217;d ice, that I know to bee true: and he is a motion</line>
<line>generatiue, that&#8217;s infallible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>You are plea&#383;ant &#383;ir, and &#383;peake apace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Why, what a ruthle&#383;&#383;e thing is this in him, for</line>
<line>the rebellion of a Cod-peece, to take away the life of a</line>
<line>man? Would the Duke that is ab&#383;ent haue done this?</line>
<line>Ere he vvould haue hang&#8217;d a man for the getting a hun-</line>
<line>dred Ba&#383;tards, he vvould haue paide for the Nur&#383;ing a</line>
<line>thou&#383;and. He had &#383;ome feeling of the &#383;port, hee knew</line>
<line>the &#383;eruice, and that in&#383;tru&#392;ted him to mercie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>I neuer heard the ab&#383;ent Duke much dete&#392;ted</line>
<line>for Women, he was not enclin&#8217;d that vvay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Oh Sir, you are deceiu&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis not po&#383;&#383;ible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of &#64257;fty:</line>
<line>and his v&#383;e was, to put a ducket in her Clack-di&#383;h; the</line>
<line>Duke had Crochets in him. Hee would be drunke too,</line>
<line>that let me informe you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>You do him wrong, &#383;urely.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I vvas an inward of his: a &#383;hie fellow vvas</line>
<line>the Duke, and I beleeue I know the cau&#383;e of his vvith-</line>
<line>drawing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>What (I prethee) might be the cau&#383;e?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>No, pardon: &#8217;Tis a &#383;ecret mu&#383;t bee lockt with-</line>
<line>in the teeth and the lippes: but this I can let you vnder-</line>
<line>&#383;tand, the greater &#64257;le of the &#383;ubie&#392;t held the Duke to be</line>
<line>vvi&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Wi&#383;e? Why no que&#383;tion but he was.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>A very &#383;uper&#64257;ciall, ignorant, vnweighing fellow</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Either this is Enuie in you, Folly, or mi&#383;ta-</line>
<line>king: The very &#383;treame of his life, and the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;e he</line>
<line>hath helmed, mu&#383;t vppon a warranted neede, giue him</line>
<line>a better proclamation. Let him be but te&#383;timonied in</line>
<line>his owne bringings forth, and hee &#383;hall appeare to the</line>
<line>enuious, a Scholler, a State&#383;man, and a Soldier: there-</line>
<line>fore you &#383;peake vnskilfully: or, if your knowledge bee</line>
<line>more, it is much darkned in your malice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I know him, and I loue him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Loue talkes with better knowledge, &amp; know-</line>
<line>ledge with deare loue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Come Sir, I know what I know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>I can hardly beleeue that, &#383;ince you know not</line>
<line>what you &#383;peake. But if euer the Duke returne (as our</line>
<line>praiers are he may) let mee de&#383;ire you to make your an-</line>
<line>&#383;wer before him: if it bee hone&#383;t you haue &#383;poke, you</line>
<line>haue courage to maintaine it; I am bound to call vppon</line>
<line>you, and I pray you your name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Sir my name is <nameref>Lucio</nameref>, wel known to the Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>He &#383;hall know you better Sir, if I may liue to</line>
<line>report you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>I feare you not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>O, you hope the Duke will returne no more:</line>
<line>or you imagine me to vnhurtfull an oppo&#383;ite: but indeed</line>
<line>I can doe you little harme: You&#8217;ll for-&#383;weare this a-</line>
<line>gaine?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Ile be hang&#8217;d &#64257;r&#383;t: Thou art deceiu&#8217;d in mee</line>
<line>Friar. But no more of this: Can&#383;t thou tell if <nameref>Claudio</nameref></line>
<line>die to morrow, or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Why &#383;hould he die Sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Why? For &#64257;lling a bottle with a Tunne-di&#383;h:</line>
<line>I would the Duke we talke of were return&#8217;d againe: this</line>
<line>vngenitur&#8217;d Agent will vn-people the Prouince with</line>
<line>Continencie. Sparrowes mu&#383;t not build in his hou&#383;e-</line>
<line>eeues, becau&#383;e they are lecherous: The Duke yet would</line>
<line>haue darke deeds darkelie an&#383;wered, hee would neuer</line>
<line>bring them to light: would hee were return&#8217;d. Marrie</line>
<line>this <nameref>Claudio</nameref> is condemned for vntru&#383;&#383;ing. Farwell good</line>
<line>Friar, I prethee pray for me: The Duke (I &#383;ay to thee</line>
<line>againe) would eate Mutton on Fridaies. He&#8217;s now pa&#383;t</line>
<line>it, yet (and I &#383;ay to thee) hee would mouth with a beg-</line>
<line>gar, though &#383;he &#383;melt browne-bread and Garlicke: &#383;ay</line>
<line>that I &#383;aid &#383;o: Farewell.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Not of this Countrie, though my chance is now</line>
<line>To v&#383;e it for my time: I am a brother</line>
<line>Of gracious Order, late come from the Sea,</line>
<line>In &#383;peciall bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;e from his Holine&#383;&#383;e.</line>

<speaker>E&#383;c.</speaker>
<line>What newes abroad i&#8217;th World?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>None, but that there is &#383;o great a Feauor on</line>
<line>goodne&#383;&#383;e, that the di&#383;&#383;olution of it mu&#383;t cure it. No-</line>
<line>ueltie is onely in reque&#383;t, and as it is as dangerous to be</line>
<line>aged in any kinde of cour&#383;e, as it is vertuous to be con-</line>
<line>&#383;tant in any vndertaking. There is &#383;car&#383;e truth enough</line>

<line>make Fellow&#383;hips accur&#383;t: Much vpon this riddle runs</line>
<line>the wi&#383;edome of the world: This newes is old enough,</line>
<line>yet it is euerie daies newes. I pray you Sir, of what di&#383;-</line>
<line>po&#383;ition was the Duke?</line>
</speech>

<speaker>E&#383;c.</speaker>
<line>One, that aboue all other &#383;trifes,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>

<line>A Gentleman of all temperance. But leaue wee him to</line>

<line>let me de&#383;ire to know, how you &#64257;nde <nameref>Claudio</nameref> prepar&#8217;d?</line>

<line>What is that <nameref>Barnardine</nameref>, who is to be execu-</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>A Bohemian borne: But here nur&#383;t vp &amp; bred,</line>
<line>One that is a pri&#383;oner nine yeeres old.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>How came it, that the ab&#383;ent Duke had not</line>
<line>either deliuer&#8217;d him to his libertie, or executed him? I</line>
<line>haue heard it was euer his manner to do &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>His friends &#383;till wrought Repreeues for him:</line>
<line>And indeed his fa&#392;t till now in the gouernment of Lord</line>
<line><nameref>Angelo</nameref>, came not to an vndoubtfull proofe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>It is now apparant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>Mo&#383;t manife&#383;t, and not denied by him&#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Hath he borne him&#383;elfe penitently in pri&#383;on?</line>
<line>How &#383;eemes he to be touch&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>A man that apprehends death no more dread-</line>
<line>fully, but as a drunken &#383;leepe, carele&#383;&#383;e, wreakle&#383;&#383;e, and</line>
<line>fearele&#383;&#383;e of what&#8217;s pa&#383;t, pre&#383;ent, or to come: in&#383;en&#383;ible</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>He wants aduice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>He wil heare none: he hath euermore had the li-</line>
<line>berty of the pri&#383;on: giue him leaue to e&#383;cape hence, hee</line>
<line>would not. Drunke many times a day, if not many daies</line>
<line>entirely drunke. We haue verie oft awak&#8217;d him, as if to</line>
<line>carrie him to execution, and &#383;hew&#8217;d him a &#383;eeming war-</line>
<line>rant for it, it hath not moued him at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>More of him anon: There is written in your</line>
<line>brow Prouo&#383;t, hone&#383;ty and con&#383;tancie; if I reade it not</line>
<line>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me: but in the boldnes</line>
<line>of my cunning, I will lay my &#383;elfe in hazard: <nameref>Claudio</nameref>,</line>
<line>whom heere you haue warrant to execute, is no greater</line>
<line>forfeit to the Law, then <nameref>Angelo</nameref> who hath &#383;entenc&#8217;d him.</line>
<line>To make you vnder&#383;tand this in a manife&#383;ted e&#64256;e&#392;t, I</line>
<line>craue but foure daies re&#383;pit: for the which, you are to</line>
<line>do me both a pre&#383;ent, and a dangerous courte&#383;ie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>Pray Sir, in what?</line>

<line>In the delaying death.</line>

<line>Alacke, how may I do it? Hauing the houre li-</line>
<line>mited, and an expre&#383;&#383;e command, vnder penaltie, to de-</line>
<line>liuer his head in the view of <nameref>Angelo</nameref>? I may make my</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>By the vow of mine Order, I warrant you,</line>
<line>If my in&#383;tru&#392;tions may be your guide,</line>
<line>Let this <nameref>Barnardine</nameref> be this morning executed,</line>
<line>And his head borne to <nameref>Angelo</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Angelo</nameref> hath &#383;eene them both,</line>
<line>And will di&#383;couer the fauour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Oh, death&#8217;s a great di&#383;gui&#383;er, and you may</line>
<line>adde to it; Shaue the head, and tie the beard, and &#383;ay it</line>
<line>was the de&#383;ire of the penitent to be &#383;o bar&#8217;de before his</line>
<line>death: you know the cour&#383;e is common. If any thing</line>
<line>fall to you vpon this, more then thankes and good for-</line>
<line>tune, by the Saint whom I profe&#383;&#383;e, I will plead again&#383;t</line>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>

<speech>

<line>You will thinke you haue made no o&#64256;ence, if</line>
<line>the Duke auouch the iu&#383;tice of your dealing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>But what likelihood is in that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Not a re&#383;emblance, but a certainty; yet &#383;ince</line>
<line>I &#383;ee you fearfull, that neither my coate, integrity, nor</line>
<line>per&#383;wa&#383;ion, can with ea&#383;e attempt you, I wil go further</line>
<line>then I meant, to plucke all feares out of you. Looke</line>
<line>you Sir, heere is the hand and Seale of the Duke: you</line>

<line>heere. This is a thing that <nameref>Angelo</nameref> knowes not, for hee</line>
<line>this very day receiues letters of &#383;trange tenor, perchance</line>
<line>of the Dukes death, perchance entering into &#383;ome Mo-</line>
<line>na&#383;terie, but by chance nothing of what is writ. Looke,</line>

<line>giue him a pre&#383;ent &#383;hrift, and adui&#383;e him for a better</line>
<line>place. Yet you are amaz&#8217;d, but this &#383;hall ab&#383;olutely re-</line>
