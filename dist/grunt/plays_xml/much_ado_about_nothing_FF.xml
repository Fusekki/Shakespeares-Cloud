</speech>

<speech>

<line>And a good &#383;ouldier to a Lady. But what is he</line> 
<line>to a Lord?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, &#383;tuft with</line>

<line>them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bea.</speaker>
<line>Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our la&#383;t con-</line>
<line>fli&#392;t, foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is</line> 
<line>the whole man gouern&#8217;d with one: &#383;o that if hee haue</line> 
<line>wit enough to keepe him&#383;elfe warme, let him beare it</line> 
<line>for a difference betweene him&#383;elfe and his hor&#383;e: For it</line> 
<line>is all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a rea&#383;o-</line>
<line>nable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath</line> 
<line>euery month a new &#383;worne brother.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t po&#383;&#383;ible?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<line>Very ea&#383;ily po&#383;&#383;ible: he weares his faith but as</line> 
<line>the fa&#383;hion of his hat, it euer changes with &#253; next block.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;ee (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your</line> 
<line>bookes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bea.</speaker>
<line>No, and he were, I would burne my &#383;tudy. But</line> 
<line>I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young</line> 
<line>&#383;quarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the</line> 
<line>diuell?</line>

<line>O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a di&#383;ea&#383;e:</line> 
<line>he is &#383;ooner caught then the pe&#383;tilence, and the taker</line> 
<line>runs pre&#383;ently mad. God helpe the noble <nameref>Claudio</nameref>, if hee</line> 
<line>haue caught the Benedi&#392;t, it will co&#383;t him a thou&#383;and</line> 
<line>pound ere he be cur&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>I will hold friends with you Lady.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ioh.</speaker>
<line>There is no mea&#383;ure in the occa&#383;ion that breeds,</line> 
<line>therefore the &#383;adne&#383;&#383;e is without limit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;hould heare rea&#383;on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iohn.</speaker>
<line>And when I haue heard it, what ble&#383;&#383;ing brin-</line>
<line>geth it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<line>If not a pre&#383;ent remedy, yet a patient &#383;ufferance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ioh.</speaker>
<line>I wonder that thou (being as thou &#383;ai&#383;t thou art,</line> 
<line>borne vnder <nameref>Saturne</nameref>) goe&#383;t about to apply a morall me-</line>
<line>dicine, to a mortifying mi&#383;chiefe: I cannot hide what I</line> 
<line>am: I mu&#383;t bee &#383;ad when I haue cau&#383;e, and &#383;mile at no</line> 
<line>mans ie&#383;ts, eat when I haue &#383;tomacke, and wait for no</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Con.</speaker>
<line>Yea, but you mu&#383;t not make the ful &#383;how of this,</line>

<line>owne harue&#383;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iohn.</speaker>
<line>I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a ro&#383;e</line> 
<line>in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be di&#383;dain&#8217;d of</line> 
<line>all, then to fa&#383;hion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this</line> 
<line>(though I cannot be &#383;aid to be a flattering hone&#383;t man)</line> 
<line>it mu&#383;t not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I</line> 
<line>am tru&#383;ted with a mu&#383;&#383;ell, and enfranchi&#383;de with a clog,</line> 
<line>therefore I haue decreed, not to &#383;ing in my cage: if I had</line> 
<line>my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do</line> 
<line>my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and</line>

<line>Too cur&#383;t is more then cur&#383;t, I &#383;hall le&#383;&#383;en Gods</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Bene.</speaker>
<line>Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady</line> 
<line>Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a</line>

<line>grace had got the will of this young Lady, and I offered</line> 
<line>him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a</line> 
<line>garland, as being for&#383;aken, or to binde him a rod, as be-</line>
<line>ing worthy to be whipt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>her, &#383;he would infe&#392;t to the north &#383;tarre: I would not</line>

<line>make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you &#383;hall finde</line> 
<line>her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God</line> 
<line>&#383;ome &#383;choller would coniure her, for certainely while &#383;he</line> 
<line>is heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a &#383;an&#392;tuary,</line> 
<line>and people &#383;inne vpon purpo&#383;e, becau&#383;e they would goe</line>

<line>I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and</line>

<line>owne &#383;corne, by falling in loue, &#38; &#383;uch a man is <nameref>Claudio</nameref>.</line> 
<line>I haue known when there was no mu&#383;icke with him but</line> 
<line>the drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the</line> 
<line>taber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue</line> 
<line>walkt ten mile afoot, to &#383;ee a good armor, and now will</line> 
<line>he lie ten nights awake caruing the fa&#383;hion of a new dub-</line>

<line>take my oath on it, till he haue made an oy&#383;ter of me, he</line> 
<line>&#383;hall neuer make me &#383;uch a foole: one woman is faire, yet</line> 
<line>I am well: another is wi&#383;e, yet I am well: another vertu-</line>
<line>ous, yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,</line> 
<line>one woman &#383;hall not come in my grace: rich &#383;hee &#383;hall</line> 
<line>be, that&#8217;s certaine: wi&#383;e, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile ne-</line>
<line>uer cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,</line> 
<line>or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of</line> 
<line>good di&#383;cour&#383;e: an excellent Mu&#383;itian, and her haire &#383;hal</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clau.</speaker>
<line>That.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<line>O &#383;he tore the letter into a thou&#383;and halfpence,</line> 
<line>raild at her &#383;elf, that &#383;he &#383;hould be &#383;o immode&#383;t to write,</line> 
<line>to one that &#383;hee knew would flout her: I mea&#383;ure him,</line>

<line>writ to mee, yea though I loue him, I &#383;hould.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clau.</speaker>
<line>Then downe vpon her knees &#383;he falls, weepes,</line> 
<line>&#383;obs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, cur&#383;es, O</line>

<line>&#383;omtime afeard &#383;he will doe a de&#383;perate out-rage to her</line> 
<line>&#383;elfe, it is very true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>It were good that <nameref>Benedicke</nameref> knew of it by &#383;ome</line> 
<line>other, if &#383;he will not di&#383;couer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clau.</speaker>
<line>To what end? he would but make a &#383;port of it,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>And he &#383;hould, it were an almes to hang him,</line>

<speaker>Claudio.</speaker>
<line>And &#383;he is exceeding wi&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>In euery thing, but in louing <nameref>Benedicke</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<line>O my Lord, wi&#383;edome and bloud combating in</line> 
<line>&#383;o tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud</line> 
<line>hath the vi&#392;tory, I am &#383;orry for her, as I haue iu&#383;t cau&#383;e,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>I would &#383;hee had be&#383;towed this dotage on</line>

<line>Were it good thinke you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clau.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Hero</nameref> thinkes &#383;urely &#383;he wil die, for &#383;he &#383;aies &#383;he</line> 
<line>will die, if hee loue her not, and &#383;hee will die ere &#383;hee</line> 
<line>make her loue knowne, and &#383;he will die if hee wooe her,</line> 
<line>rather than &#383;hee will bate one breath of her accu&#383;tomed</line> 
<line>cro&#383;&#383;ene&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>She doth well, if &#383;he &#383;hould make tender of her</line> 
<line>loue, &#8216;tis very po&#383;&#383;ible hee&#8217;l &#383;corne it, for the man (as you</line> 
<line>know all) hath a contemptible &#383;pirit.</line>
</speech>

<line>them with great di&#383;cretion, or vndertakes them with a</line> 
<line>Chri&#383;tian-like feare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Leon.</speaker>
<line>If hee doe feare God, a mu&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;arilie keepe</line> 
<line>peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a</line> 
<line>quarrell with feare and trembling.</line>

<line>And &#383;o will he doe, for the man doth fear God,</line>

</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Bene.</speaker>
<line>This can be no tricke, the conference was &#383;adly</line> 
<line>borne, they haue the truth of this from <nameref>Hero</nameref>, they &#383;eeme</line> 
<line>to pittie the Lady: it &#383;eemes her affe&#392;tions haue the full</line> 
<line>bent: loue me? why it mu&#383;t be requited: I heare how I</line> 
<line>am cen&#383;ur&#8217;d, they &#383;ay I will beare my &#383;elfe proudly, if I</line> 
<line>perceiue the loue come from her: they &#383;ay too, that &#383;he</line> 
<line>will rather die than giue any &#383;igne of affe&#392;tion: I did ne-</line>
<line>uer thinke to marry, I mu&#383;t not &#383;eeme proud, happy are</line> 
<line>they that heare their detra&#392;tions, and can put them to</line> 
<line>mending: they &#383;ay the Lady is faire, &#8216;tis a truth, I can</line> 
<line>beare them witne&#383;&#383;e: and vertuous, tis &#383;o, I cannot re-</line>
<line>prooue it, and wi&#383;e, but for louing me, by my troth it is</line> 
<line>no addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her</line> 
<line>folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance</line> 
<line>haue &#383;ome odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken</line> 
<line>on mee, becau&#383;e I haue rail&#8217;d &#383;o long again&#383;t marriage:</line> 
<line>but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in</line> 
<line>his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips</line> 
<line>and &#383;entences, and the&#383;e paper bullets of the braine awe</line> 
<line>a man from the careere of his humour? No, the world</line> 
<line>mu&#383;t be peopled. When I &#383;aid I would die a batcheler, I</line> 
<line>did not think I &#383;hould liue till I were maried, here comes</line> 
<line><nameref>Beatrice</nameref>: by this day, &#383;hee&#8217;s a faire Lady, I doe &#383;pie &#383;ome</line> 
<line>markes of loue in her.</line>

<speaker>Bene.</speaker>
<line>Faire <nameref>Beatrice</nameref>, I thanke you for your paines.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Beat.</speaker>
<line>I tooke no more paines for tho&#383;e thankes, then</line> 
<line>you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I</line> 
<line>would not haue come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bene.</speaker>
<line>You take plea&#383;ure then in the me&#383;&#383;age.</line>

<speaker>Bene.</speaker>
<line>Ha, again&#383;t my will I am &#383;ent to bid you come</line>

<line>no more paines for tho&#383;e thankes then you took paines</line> 
<line>to thanke me, that&#8217;s as much as to &#383;ay, any paines that I</line> 
<line>take for you is as ea&#383;ie as thankes: if I do not take pitty</line> 
<line>of her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Vr&#383;ula.</speaker>
<line>But are you &#383;ure,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<line>So &#383;aies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vr&#383;.</speaker>
<line>And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Her.</speaker>
<line>They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,</line>
<line>But I per&#383;waded them, if they lou&#8217;d <nameref>Benedicke</nameref>,</line>
<line>To wi&#383;h him wra&#383;tle with affe&#392;tion,</line>
<line>And neuer to let <nameref>Beatrice</nameref> know of it.</line>

<line>As euer <nameref>Beatrice</nameref> &#383;hall couch vpon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hero.</speaker>
<line>O God of loue! I know he doth de&#383;erue,</line>
<line>As much as may be yeelded to a man:</line>
<line>But Nature neuer fram&#8217;d a womans heart,</line>
<line>Of prowder &#383;tuffe then that of <nameref>Beatrice</nameref>:</line>
<line>Di&#383;daine and Scorne ride &#383;parkling in her eyes,</line>
<line>Mi&#383;-prizing what they looke on, and her wit</line>
<line>Values it &#383;elfe &#383;o highly, that to her</line>
<line>All matter el&#383;e &#383;eemes weake: &#383;he cannot loue,</line>
<line>Nor take no &#383;hape nor proie&#392;t of affe&#392;tion,</line>
<line>Shee is &#383;o &#383;elfe indeared.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vr&#383;ula.</speaker>
<line>Sure I thinke &#383;o,</line>
<line>And therefore certainely it were not good</line>
<line>She knew his loue, le&#383;t &#383;he make &#383;port at it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hero.</speaker>
<line>Why you &#383;peake truth, I neuer yet &#383;aw man,</line>
<line>How wi&#383;e, how noble, yong, how rarely featur&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But &#383;he would &#383;pell him backward: if faire fac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>She would &#383;weare the gentleman &#383;hould be her &#383;i&#383;ter:</line>
<line>If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,</line>
<line>Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:</line>
<line>If low, an agot very vildlie cut:</line>
<line>If &#383;peaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:</line>
<line>If &#383;ilent, why a blocke moued with none.</line>
<line>So turnes &#383;he euery man the wrong &#383;ide out,</line>
<line>And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that</line>
<line>Which &#383;implene&#383;&#383;e and merit purcha&#383;eth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vr&#383;u.</speaker>
<line>Sure, &#383;ure, &#383;uch carping is not commendable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hero.</speaker>
<line>No, not to be &#383;o odde, and from all fa&#383;hions,</line>
<line>As <nameref>Beatrice</nameref> is, cannot be commendable,</line>
<line>But who dare tell her &#383;o? if I &#383;hould &#383;peake,</line>
<line>She would mocke me into ayre, O &#383;he would laugh me</line>
<line>Out of my &#383;elfe, pre&#383;&#383;e me to death with wit,</line>
<line>Therefore let <nameref>Benedicke</nameref> like couered fire,</line>
<line>Con&#383;ume away in &#383;ighes, wa&#383;te inwardly:</line>
<line>It were a better death, to die with mockes,</line>
<line>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vr&#383;u.</speaker>
<line>Yet tell her of it, heare what &#383;hee will &#383;ay.</line>

<line>There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnle&#383;&#383;e</line> 
<line>it be a fancy that he hath to &#383;trange di&#383;gui&#383;es, as to bee a</line>

<line>haue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee</line> 
<line>is no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare</line>

<line>Are you good men and true?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verg.</speaker>
<line>Yea, or el&#383;e it were pitty but they &#383;hould &#383;uffer</line> 
<line>&#383;aluation body and &#383;oule.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that were a puni&#383;hment too good for</line> 
<line>them, if they &#383;hould haue any allegiance in them, being</line> 
<line>cho&#383;en for the Princes watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>Well, giue them their charge, neighbour</line>
<line><nameref>Dogbery</nameref>.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Fir&#383;t, who thinke you the mo&#383;t de&#383;artle&#383;&#383;e man</line> 
<line>to be Con&#383;table?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.1.</speaker>
<line><nameref>Hugh Ote-cake</nameref> &#383;ir, or <nameref>George Sea-coale</nameref>, for</line> 
<line>they can write and reade.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath</line> 
<line>ble&#383;t you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,</line> 
<line>is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by</line> 
<line>Nature.</line> 
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch 2.</speaker>
<line>Both which Ma&#383;ter Con&#383;table</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>You haue: I knew it would be your an&#383;were:</line> 
<line>well, for your fauour &#383;ir, why giue God thankes, &#38; make</line> 
<line>no boa&#383;t of it, and for your writing and reading, let that</line> 
<line>appeare when there is no need of &#383;uch vanity, you are</line> 
<line>thought heere to be the mo&#383;t &#383;ensle&#383;&#383;e and fit man for the</line> 
<line>Con&#383;table of the watch: therefore beare you the lan-</line>
<line>thorne: this is your charge: You &#383;hall comprehend all</line> 
<line>vagrom men, you are to bid any man &#383;tand in the Prin-</line>
<line>ces name.</line> 
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch 2.</speaker>
<line>How if a will not &#383;tand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>Why then take no note of him, but let him go,</line> 
<line>and pre&#383;ently call the re&#383;t of the Watch together, and</line> 
<line>thanke God you are ridde of a knaue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>If he will not &#383;tand when he is bidden, hee is</line> 
<line>none of the Princes &#383;ubie&#392;ts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>True, and they are to meddle with none but</line> 
<line>the Princes &#383;ubie&#392;ts: you &#383;hall al&#383;o make no noi&#383;e in the</line> 
<line>&#383;treetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is mo&#383;t</line> 
<line>tollerable, and not to be indured.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.</speaker>
<line>We will rather &#383;leepe than talke, wee know</line> 
<line>what belongs to a Watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Why you &#383;peake like an ancient and mo&#383;t quiet</line> 
<line>watchman, for I cannot &#383;ee how &#383;leeping &#383;hould offend:</line> 
<line>only haue a care that your bills be not &#383;tolne: well, you</line> 
<line>are to call at all the Alehou&#383;es, and bid them that are</line> 
<line>drunke get them to bed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.</speaker>
<line>How if they will not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>Why then let them alone till they are &#383;ober, if</line> 
<line>they make you not then the better an&#383;were, you may &#383;ay,</line> 
<line>they are not the men you tooke them for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.</speaker>
<line>Well &#383;ir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>If you meet a theefe, you may &#383;u&#383;pe&#392;t him, by</line> 
<line>vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for &#383;uch</line> 
<line>kinde of men, the le&#383;&#383;e you meddle or make with them,</line> 
<line>why the more is for your hone&#383;ty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.</speaker>
<line>If wee know him to be a thiefe, &#383;hall wee not</line> 
<line>lay hands on him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dogb.</speaker>
<line>Truly by your office you may, but I think they</line> 
<line>that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d: the mo&#383;t peaceable way</line> 
<line>for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him &#383;hew him-</line>
<line>&#383;elfe what he is, and &#383;teale out of your company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ver.</speaker>
<line>You haue bin alwaies cal&#8217;d a merciful m&#227; partner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Truely I would not hang a dog by my will, much</line> 
<line>more a man who hath anie hone&#383;tie in him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>If you heare a child crie in the night you mu&#383;t</line> 
<line>call to the nur&#383;e, and bid her &#383;till it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Watch.</speaker>
<line>How if the nur&#383;e be a&#383;leepe and will not</line> 
<line>heare vs?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Why then depart in peace, and let the childe</line> 
<line>wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare</line> 
<line>her Lambe when it baes, will neuer an&#383;were a calfe when</line> 
<line>he bleates.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis verie true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>This is the end of the charge: you con&#383;table</line> 
<line>are to pre&#383;ent the Princes owne per&#383;on, if you meete the</line> 
<line>Prince in the night, you may &#383;taie him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Fiue &#383;hillings to one on&#8217;t with anie man that</line> 
<line>knowes the Statutes, he may &#383;taie him, marrie not with-</line>
<line>out the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to</line> 
<line>offend no man, and it is an offence to &#383;tay a man again&#383;t</line> 
<line>his will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Verges.</speaker>
<line>Birladie I thinke it be &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dog.</speaker>
<line>Ha, ah ha, well ma&#383;ters good night, and there be</line> 
<line>anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your</line>

<line>Into the eye and prospe&#392;t of his &#383;oule</line>
<line>Then when &#383;he liu&#8217;d indeed: then &#383;hal he mourne,</line>
