<line>Sure we thanke you.</line>
<line>My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,</line>

<line>Or nicely charge your vnder&#383;tanding Soule,</line>
<line>With opening Titles mi&#383;create, who&#383;e right</line>
<line>Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:</line>
<line>For God doth know, how many now in health,</line>
<line>Shall drop their blood, in approbation</line>
<line>Of what your reuerence &#383;hall incite vs to.</line>
<line>Therefore take heed how you impawne our Per&#383;on,</line>
<line>How you awake our &#383;leeping Sword of Warre;</line>
<line>We charge you in the Name of God take heed:</line>
<line>For neuer two &#383;uch Kingdomes did contend,</line>
<line>Without much fall of blood, who&#383;e guiltle&#383;&#383;e drops</line>
<line>Are euery one, a Woe, a &#383;ore Complaint,</line>

<line>As pure as &#383;inne with Bapti&#383;me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B. Can.</speaker>
<line>Then heare me gracious Soueraign, &amp; you Peers,</line>
<line>That owe your &#383;elues, your liues, and &#383;eruices,</line>
<line>To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre</line>
<line>To make again&#383;t your Highne&#383;&#383;e Clayme to France,</line>
<line>But this which they produce from <nameref>Pharamond</nameref>,</line>

<line>To be the Realme of France, and <nameref>Pharamond</nameref></line>
<line>The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.</line>

<line>Then doth it well appeare, the <nameref>Salike</nameref> Law</line>

<line>it, that &#383;hee is turning and incon&#383;tant, and mutabilitie,</line>
<line>and variation: and her foot, looke you, is &#64257;xed vpon a</line>
<line>Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:</line>
<line>in good truth, the Poet makes a mo&#383;t excellent de&#383;cripti-</line>
<line>on of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pi&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Fortune is <nameref>Bardolphs</nameref> foe, and frownes on him:</line>

<line>the Duke to v&#383;e his good plea&#383;ure, and put him to execu-</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>He hath not told his thought to the King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No: nor it is not meet he &#383;hould: for though I</line>
<line>&#383;peake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:</line>
<line>the Violet &#383;mells to him, as it doth to me; the Element</line>
<line>&#383;hewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but</line>
<line>humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Na-</line>
<line>kedne&#383;&#383;e he appeares but a man; and though his a&#64256;e&#392;ti-</line>
<line>ons are higher mounted then ours, yet when they &#383;toupe,</line>
<line>they &#383;toupe with the like wing: therefore, when he &#383;ees</line>
<line>rea&#383;on of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of</line>
<line>the &#383;ame relli&#383;h as ours are: yet in rea&#383;on, no man &#383;hould</line>
<line>po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;e him with any appearance of feare; lea&#383;t hee, by</line>
<line>&#383;hewing it, &#383;hould dis-hearten his Army.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>He may &#383;hew what outward courage he will:</line>
<line>but I beleeue, as cold a Night as &#8217;tis, hee could wi&#383;h him-</line>
<line>&#383;elfe in Thames vp to the Neck; and &#383;o I would he were,</line>
<line>and I by him, at all aduentures, &#383;o we were quit here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I will &#383;peake my con&#383;cience of the</line>
<line>King: I thinke hee would not wi&#383;h him&#383;elfe any where,</line>
<line>but where hee is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>Then I would he were here alone; &#383;o &#383;hould he be</line>
<line>&#383;ure to be ran&#383;omed, and a many poore mens liues &#383;aued.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>I dare &#383;ay, you loue him not &#383;o ill, to wi&#383;h him</line>
<line>here alone: how&#383;oeuer you &#383;peake this to feele other</line>
<line>mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where &#383;o con-</line>
<line>tented, as in the Kings company; his Cau&#383;e being iu&#383;t, and</line>
<line>his Quarrell honorable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Williams.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s more then we know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>I, or more then wee &#383;hould &#383;eeke after; for wee</line>
<line>know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subie&#392;ts:</line>
<line>if his Cau&#383;e be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes</line>
<line>the Cryme of it out of vs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Williams.</speaker>
<line>But if the Cau&#383;e be not good, the King him-</line>
<line>&#383;elfe hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all tho&#383;e</line>
<line>Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt o&#64256; in a Battaile,</line>
<line>&#383;hall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dy-</line>
<line>ed at &#383;uch a place, &#383;ome &#383;wearing, &#383;ome crying for a Sur-</line>
<line>gean; &#383;ome vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;</line>
<line>&#383;ome vpon the Debts they owe, &#383;ome vpon their Children</line>
<line>rawly left: I am afear&#8217;d, there are few dye well, that dye</line>
<line>in a Battaile: for how can they charitably di&#383;po&#383;e of any</line>
<line>thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if the&#383;e men</line>
<line>doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,</line>
<line>that led them to it; who to di&#383;obey, were again&#383;t all pro-</line>
<line>portion of &#383;ubie&#392;tion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>So, if a Sonne that is by his Father &#383;ent about</line>
<line>Merchandize, doe &#383;infully mi&#383;carry vpon the Sea; the im-</line>
<line>putation of his wickedne&#383;&#383;e, by your rule, &#383;hould be im-</line>
<line>po&#383;ed vpon his Father that &#383;ent him: or if a Seruant, vn-</line>
<line>der his Ma&#383;ters command, tran&#383;porting a &#383;umme of Mo-</line>
<line>ney, be a&#383;&#383;ayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil&#8217;d</line>
<line>Iniquities; you may call the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;e of the Ma&#383;ter the</line>
<line>author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not &#383;o:</line>
<line>The King is not bound to an&#383;wer the particular endings</line>
<line>of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Ma&#383;ter</line>
<line>of his Seruant; for they purpo&#383;e not their death, when</line>
<line>they purpo&#383;e their &#383;eruices. Be&#383;ides, there is no King, be</line>
<line>his Cau&#383;e neuer &#383;o &#383;potle&#383;&#383;e, if it come to the arbitre-</line>
<line>ment of Swords, can trye it out with all vn&#383;potted Soul-</line>
<line>diers: &#383;ome (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of</line>
<line>premeditated and contriued Murther; &#383;ome, of begui-</line>
<line>ling Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; &#383;ome,</line>
<line>making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before go-</line>
<line>red the gentle Bo&#383;ome of Peace with Pillage and Robbe-</line>
<line>rie. Now, if the&#383;e men haue defeated the Law, and out-</line>
<line>runne Natiue puni&#383;hment; though they can out-&#383;trip</line>
<line>men, they haue no wings to &#64258;ye from God. Warre is</line>
<line>his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: &#383;o that here men</line>
<line>are puni&#383;ht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in</line>
<line>now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,</line>
<line>they haue borne life away; and where they would bee</line>
<line>&#383;afe, they peri&#383;h. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more</line>
<line>is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was be-</line>
<line>fore guiltie of tho&#383;e Impieties, for the which they are</line>
<line>now vi&#383;ited. Euery Subie&#392;ts Dutie is the Kings, but</line>
<line>euery Subie&#392;ts Soule is his owne. Therefore &#383;hould</line>
<line>euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery &#383;icke man in</line>
<line>his Bed, wa&#383;h euery Moth out of his Con&#383;cience: and</line>
<line>dying &#383;o, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,</line>
<line>the time was ble&#383;&#383;edly lo&#383;t, wherein &#383;uch preparation was</line>
<line>gayned: and in him that e&#383;capes, it were not &#383;inne to</line>
<line>thinke, that making God &#383;o free an o&#64256;er, he let him out-</line>
<line>liue that day, to &#383;ee his Greatne&#383;&#383;e, and to teach others</line>
<line>how they &#383;hould prepare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Will.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon</line>
<line>his owne head, the King is not to an&#383;wer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>I doe not de&#383;ire hee &#383;hould an&#383;wer for me, and</line>
<line>yet I determine to &#64257;ght lu&#383;tily for him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I my &#383;elfe heard the King &#383;ay he would not be</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Will.</speaker>
<line>I, hee &#383;aid &#383;o, to make vs &#64257;ght chearefully: but</line>
<line>when our throats are cut, hee may be ran&#383;om&#8217;d, and wee</line>

<line>You pay him then: that&#8217;s a perillous &#383;hot out</line>
<line>of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate di&#383;plea&#383;ure</line>
<line>can doe again&#383;t a Monarch: you may as well goe about</line>

<speech>

<line>Your reproofe is &#383;omething too round, I &#383;hould</line>

<line>Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,</line>
<line>Athwart the Sea: Behold the Engli&#383;h beach</line>

<line>So &#383;wift a pace hath Thought, that euen now</line>
<line>You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath:</line>
<line>Where, that his Lords de&#383;ire him, to haue borne</line>
<line>His brui&#383;ed Helmet, and his bended Sword</line>
<line>Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,</line>
<line>Being free from vain-ne&#383;&#383;e, and &#383;elfe-glorious pride;</line>
<line>Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and O&#383;tent,</line>
<line>Quite from him&#383;elfe, to God. But now behold,</line>
<line>In the quick Forge and working-hou&#383;e of Thought,</line>
<line>How London doth powre out her Citizens,</line>
<line>The Maior and all his Brethren in be&#383;t &#383;ort,</line>

<line>Were now the Generall of our gracious Empre&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,</line>
<line>Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;</line>
<line>How many would the peacefull Citie quit,</line>
<line>To welcome him? much more, and much more cau&#383;e,</line>
<line>Did they this <nameref>Harry</nameref>. Now in London place him.</line>
<line>As yet the lamentation of the French</line>
<line>Inuites the King of Englands &#383;tay at home:</line>
<line>The Emperour&#8217;s comming in behalfe of France,</line>
<line>To order peace betweene them: and omit</line>
<line>All the occurrences, what euer chanc&#8217;t,</line>

<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Marry, if you would put me to Ver&#383;es, or to</line>
<line>Dance for your &#383;ake, <nameref>Kate</nameref>, why you vndid me: for the one</line>
<line>I haue neither words nor mea&#383;ure; and for the other, I</line>
<line>haue no &#383;trength in mea&#383;ure, yet a rea&#383;onable mea&#383;ure in</line>
<line>&#383;trength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by</line>
<line>vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;</line>
<line>vnder the corre&#392;tion of bragging be it &#383;poken. I &#383;hould</line>
<line>quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might bu&#64256;et for my</line>
<line>Loue, or bound my Hor&#383;e for her fauours, I could lay on</line>
<line>like a Butcher, and &#383;it like a Iack an Apes, neuer o&#64256;. But</line>
<line>before God <nameref>Kate</nameref>, I cannot looke greenely, nor ga&#383;pe out</line>
<line>my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in prote&#383;tation;</line>
<line>onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer v&#383;e till vrg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou can&#383;t loue a fellow</line>
<line>of this temper, <nameref>Kate</nameref>, who&#383;e face is not worth Sunne-bur-</line>
<line>ning? that neuer lookes in his Gla&#383;&#383;e, for loue of any</line>
<line>thing he &#383;ees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I &#383;peake</line>
<line>to thee plaine Souldier: If thou can&#383;t loue me for this,</line>
<line>take me? if not? to &#383;ay to thee that I &#383;hall dye, is true; but</line>
<line>for thy loue, by the L. No: yet I loue thee too. And</line>
<line>while thou liu&#8217;&#383;t, deare <nameref>Kate</nameref>, take a fellow of plaine and</line>
<line>vncoyned Con&#383;tancie, for he perforce mu&#383;t do thee right,</line>
<line>becau&#383;e he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for</line>
<line>the&#383;e fellowes of in&#64257;nit tongue, that can ryme them&#383;elues</line>
<line>into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes rea&#383;on them&#383;elues</line>
<line>out againe. What? a &#383;peaker is but a prater, a Ryme is</line>
<line>but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a &#383;trait Backe will</line>
<line>&#383;toope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl&#8217;d Pate will</line>
<line>grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax</line>
<line>hollow: but a good Heart, <nameref>Kate</nameref>, is the Sunne and the</line>
<line>Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it</line>
<line>&#383;hines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his cour&#383;e</line>
<line>truly. If thou would haue &#383;uch a one, take me? and</line>
<line>take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.</line>
<line>And what &#383;ay&#8217;&#383;t thou then to my Loue? &#383;peake my faire,</line>
<line>and fairely, I pray thee.</line>
