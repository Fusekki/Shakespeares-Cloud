<line>Thou art a Traitor, and a Mi&#383;creant;</line>
<line>Too good to be &#383;o, and too bad to liue,</line>
<line>Since the more faire and chri&#383;tall is the skie,</line>
<line>The vglier &#383;eeme the cloudes that in it &#64258;ye:</line>

<speaker>Mow.</speaker>

<line>&#8217;Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,</line>
<line>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</line>
<line>Can arbitrate this cau&#383;e betwixt vs twaine:</line>
<line>The blood is hot that mu&#383;t be cool&#8217;d for this.</line>

<line>Setting a&#383;ide his high bloods royalty,</line>
<line>And let him be no Kin&#383;man to my Liege,</line>
<line>I do de&#64257;e him, and I &#383;pit at him,</line>
<line>Call him a &#383;landerous Coward, and a Villaine:</line>
<line>Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,</line>
<line>And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,</line>
<line>Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,</line>
<line>Or any other ground inhabitable,</line>

<line>If guilty dread hath le&#64261; thee &#383;o much &#383;trength,</line>
<line>As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then &#383;toope.</line>

<line>Ile an&#383;wer thee in any faire degree,</line>
<line>Or Chiualrous de&#383;igne of knightly triall:</line>
<line>And when I mount, aliue may I not light,</line>
<line>If I be Traitor, or vniu&#383;tly &#64257;ght.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What doth our Co&#383;in lay to <nameref>Mowbraies</nameref> charge?</line>
<line>It mu&#383;t be great that can inherite vs,</line>

<line>Looke what I &#383;aid, my life &#383;hall proue it true,</line>

<line>That all the Trea&#383;ons for the&#383;e eighteene yeeres</line>
<line>Complotted, and contriued in this Land,</line>
<line>Fetch&#8217;d from fal&#383;e <nameref>Mowbray</nameref> their &#64257;r&#383;t head and &#383;pring.</line>
<line>Further I &#383;ay, and further will maintaine</line>
<line>Vpon his bad life, to make all this good.</line>
<line>That he did plot the Duke of Glou&#383;ters death,</line>
<line>Sugge&#383;t his &#383;oone beleeuing aduer&#383;aries,</line>
<line>And con&#383;equently, like a Traitor Coward,</line>
<line>Sluc&#8217;d out his innocent &#383;oule through &#383;treames of blood:</line>
<line>Which blood, like &#383;acri&#64257;cing <nameref>Abels</nameref> cries,</line>
<line>(Euen from the toongle&#383;&#383;e cauernes of the earth)</line>
<line>To me for iu&#383;tice, and rough cha&#383;ticement:</line>
<line>And by the glorious worth of my di&#383;cent,</line>
<line>This arme &#383;hall do it, or this life be &#383;pent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>How high a pitch his re&#383;olution &#383;oares:</line>
<line><nameref>Thomas</nameref> of Norfolke, what &#383;aye&#383;t thou to this?</line>

<line>Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face,</line>
<line>And bid his eares a little while be deafe,</line>
<line>Till I haue told this &#383;lander of his blood,</line>
<line>How God, and good men, hate &#383;o foule a lyar.</line>
</speech>

<line>Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre,</line>
<line>As he is but my fathers brothers &#383;onne;</line>
<line>Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow,</line>
<line>Such neighbour-neerene&#383;&#383;e to our &#383;acred blood,</line>
<line>Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize</line>
<line>The vn-&#383;tooping &#64257;rmene&#383;&#383;e of my vpright &#383;oule.</line>
<line>He is our &#383;ubie&#392;t (<nameref>Mowbray</nameref>) &#383;o art thou,</line>

<line>Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice,</line>
<line>Disbur&#383;t I to his Highne&#383;&#383;e &#383;ouldiers;</line>
<line>The other part re&#383;eru&#8217;d I by con&#383;ent,</line>

<line>The honourable Father to my f&#339;,</line>
<line>Once I did lay an ambu&#383;h for your life,</line>

<line>This is my fault: as for the re&#383;t appeal&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It i&#383;&#383;ues from the rancour of a Villaine,</line>
<line>A recreant, and mo&#383;t degenerate Traitor,</line>
<line>Which in my &#383;elfe I boldly will defend,</line>
<line>And interchangeably hurle downe my gage</line>
<line>Vpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote,</line>
<line>To proue my &#383;elfe a loyall Gentleman,</line>

<line>I haue bin &#383;tudying, how to compare</line>
<line>This Pri&#383;on where I liue, vnto the World:</line>
<line>And for becau&#383;e the world is populous,</line>
<line>And heere is not a Creature, but my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer&#8217;t out.</line>
<line>My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule,</line>
<line>My Soule, the Father: and the&#383;e two beget</line>
<line>A generation of &#383;till breeding Thoughts;</line>
<line>And the&#383;e &#383;ame Thoughts, people this Little World</line>
<line>In humors, like the people of this world,</line>
<line>For no thought is contented. The better &#383;ort,</line>
<line>As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt</line>
<line>With &#383;cruples, and do &#383;et the Faith it &#383;elfe</line>
<line>Again&#383;t the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: &amp; then again,</line>
<line>It is as hard to come, as for a Camell</line>
<line>To thred the po&#383;terne of a Needles eye.</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot</line>
<line>Vnlikely wonders; how the&#383;e vaine weake nailes</line>
<line>May teare a pa&#383;&#383;age through the Flinty ribbes</line>
<line>Of this hard world, my ragged pri&#383;on walles:</line>
<line>And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride.</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to Content, &#64258;atter them&#383;elues,</line>
<line>That they are not the &#64257;r&#383;t of Fortunes &#383;laues,</line>
<line>Nor &#383;hall not be the la&#383;t. Like &#383;illy Beggars,</line>
<line>Who &#383;itting in the Stockes, refuge their &#383;hame</line>
<line>That many haue, and others mu&#383;t &#383;it there;</line>
<line>And in this Thought, they &#64257;nde a kind of ea&#383;e,</line>
<line>Bearing their owne mi&#383;fortune on the backe</line>
<line>Of &#383;uch as haue before indur&#8217;d the like.</line>
<line>Thus play I in one Pri&#383;on, many people,</line>
<line>And none contented. Sometimes am I King;</line>
<line>Then Trea&#383;on makes me wi&#383;h my &#383;elfe a Beggar,</line>
<line>And &#383;o I am. Then cru&#383;hing penurie,</line>
<line>Per&#383;wades me, I was better when a King:</line>
<line>Then am I king&#8217;d againe: and by and by,</line>
<line>Thinke that I am vn-king&#8217;d by <nameref>Bullingbrooke</nameref>,</line>
<line>And &#383;traight am nothing. But what ere I am,<stagedir>Mu&#383;ick</stagedir></line>
<line>Nor I, nor any man, that but man is,</line>
<line>With nothing &#383;hall be pleas&#8217;d, till he be eas&#8217;d</line>
<line>With being nothing. Mu&#383;icke do I heare?</line>
<line>Ha, ha? keepe time: How &#383;owre &#383;weet Mu&#383;icke is,</line>
<line>When Time is broke, and no Proportion kept?</line>
<line>So is it in the Mu&#383;icke of mens liues:</line>
<line>And heere haue I the daintine&#383;&#383;e of eare,</line>
<line>To heare time broke in a di&#383;order&#8217;d &#383;tring:</line>
<line>But for the Concord of my State and Time,</line>
<line>Had not an eare to heare my true Time broke.</line>
<line>I wa&#383;ted Time, and now doth Time wa&#383;te me:</line>
<line>For now hath Time made me his numbring clocke;</line>
<line>My Thoughts, are minutes; and with Sighes they iarre,</line>
<line>Their watches on vnto mine eyes, the outward Watch,</line>
<line>Whereto my &#64257;nger, like a Dialls point,</line>
<line>Is pointing &#383;till, in clean&#383;ing them from teares.</line>
<line>Now &#383;ir, the &#383;ound that tels what houre it is,</line>
<line>Are clamorous groanes, that &#383;trike vpon my heart,</line>
<line>Which is the bell: &#383;o Sighes, and Teares, and Grones,</line>
<line>Shew Minutes, Houres, and Times: but my Time</line>
<line>Runs poa&#383;ting on, in <nameref>Bullingbrookes</nameref> proud ioy,</line>
<line>While I &#383;tand fooling heere, his iacke o&#8217;th&#8217; Clocke.</line>
<line>This Mu&#383;icke mads me, let it &#383;ound no more,</line>
<line>For though it haue holpe madmen to their wits,</line>
<line>In me it &#383;eemes, it will make wi&#383;e-men mad:</line>
<line>Yet ble&#383;&#383;ing on his heart that giues it me;</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis a &#383;igne of loue, and loue to <nameref>Richard</nameref>,</line>
<line>Is a &#383;trange Brooch, in this all-hating world.</line>

<line>Forgiuene&#383;&#383;e hor&#383;e: Why do I raile on thee,</line>
<line>Since thou created to be aw&#8217;d by man</line>
<line>Was&#8217;t borne to beare? I was not made a hor&#383;e,</line>
