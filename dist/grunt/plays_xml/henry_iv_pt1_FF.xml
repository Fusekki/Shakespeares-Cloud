<line>My Liege, I did deny no Pri&#383;oners.</line>
<line>But, I remember when the &#64257;ght was done,</line>
<line>When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,</line>
<line>Breathle&#383;&#383;e, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,</line>
<line>Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly dre&#383;t;</line>
<line>Fre&#383;h as a Bride-groome, and his Chin new reapt,</line>
<line>Shew&#8217;d like a &#383;tubble Land at Harue&#383;t home.</line>
<line>He was perfumed like a Milliner,</line>
<line>And &#8217;twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he held</line>
<line>A Pouncet-box: which euer and anon</line>
<line>He gaue his No&#383;e, and took&#8217;t away againe:</line>
<line>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</line>
<line>Tooke it in Snu&#64256;e. And &#383;till he &#383;mil&#8217;d and talk&#8217;d:</line>
<line>And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,</line>
<line>He call&#8217;d them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,</line>
<line>To bring a &#383;louenly vnhand&#383;ome Coar&#383;e</line>

<line>An&#383;wer&#8217;d (negle&#392;tingly) I know not what,</line>

<line>And talke &#383;o like a Waiting-Gentlewoman,</line>

<line>By being &#383;eldome &#383;eene, I could not &#383;tirre,</line>

<line>terfeit; to dye, is to be a counterfeit, for hee is but the</line>
<line>counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man: But</line>
<line>to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liueth, is to be</line>
<line>no counterfeit, but the true and perfe&#392;t image of life in-</line>
<line>deede. The better part of Valour, is Di&#383;cretion; in the</line>
<line>which better part, I haue &#383;aued my life. I am a&#64256;raide of</line>
